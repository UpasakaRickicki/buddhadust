					<p class="f4">On one occasion, at Sāvatthi, the Exalted One fell ill with intestinal wind.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Upavāna was attending on the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One appealed to him, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Prithee, Upavāna,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> dost know how I can get hot water?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Surely, lord,' responded the venerable Upavāna, and making ready he took bowl and robe,<br />
					and sought the dwelling of the brahmin Devahita.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he got there he stood silently aside.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now Devahita saw him standing thus in silence, and addressed him in the verse: —</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">His Worship standing there and speaking not,<br />
							With shaven head and face, wrapped in his cloak,<br />
							What doth he wish for, what may be his quest,<br />
							What would he beg, that he is thither come?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4 in2">[Upavāna: —]</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">An Arahant, the Blessed of all men,<br />
							A holy sage, he suffereth sore with wind.<br />
							It there be any water heated here,<br />
							0 give it to me, brahmin, for the sage.<br />
							Revered by them to whom we reverence owe,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Cherished by them who claim our pious care,<br />
							Honoured by them to whom honour is due,<br />
							For him I do beseech it may be brought.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Devahita the brahmin made a serving man take hot water on a carrying-pole<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> and a jar of molasses,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> and offered them to the venerable Upavāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Upavana came to the Exalted One and administered them to him,<br />
					fomenting with the hot water and mixing the molasses with hot water.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the illness of the Exalted One abated.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Devahita the brahmin came to visit the Exalted One, and exchanging with him the greetings of courtesy and amity, took his seat at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he addressed the Exalted One in the verse:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Where should he give<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> who hath a gift to make?<br />
							Where given, will his offering bear much fruit?<br />
							Yea, how to him who doth oblation bring —<br />
							How shall his tribute work effectively?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">[The Exalted One:—]</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Whose<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> vision many former lives hath pierced.<br />
							Who sees the heavens above, the depths below,<br />
							Whose is't to win the doing down of birth: —<br />
							Master of supernormal lore, a seer: —<br />
							There should he give who hath a gift to make,<br />
							There given, will his offering bear much fruit,<br />
							Yea, thus to him who doth oblation bring —<br />
							Thus shall his tribute work effectively.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had thus spoken, Devahita the brahmin said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Most excellent, Master Gotama, most excellent!</p>

					<p class="f4">As if one raised up that which had been overthrown,<br />
					or revealed that which had been hidden,<br />
					or declared the way to one who was bewildered,<br />
					or carried an oil-lamp into the dark,<br />
					so that they that had eyes could see,<br />
					even so is the Norm in many ways made manifest by Master Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lo! I go for refuge to Gotama the Exalted One,<br />
					to the Norm,<br />
					and to the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">May Master Gotama suffer me as a lay-adherent,<br />
					who from this day forth<br />
					as long as life endures<br />
					has taken in him refuge!'</p>
