					<p class="f4">The venerable Vaŋgīsa<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> was once staying near Ālāvi<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> at the chief temple<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> of that place, together with his tutor, the venerable Nigrodha-Kappa.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion the venerable Vaŋgīsa was a novice,<br />
					not long ordained,<br />
					who was left behind as custodian at the Vihāra.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then a number of women,<br />
					gaily adorned,<br />
					came into the pleasance to see the Vihāra.<br />
					And seeing those women,<br />
					disaffection<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> in consequence arose in the venerable Vaŋgīsa,<br />
					and lust harassed his heart.<br />
					And then he thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Alas! the loss to me!<br />
					Alas! no gain to me!<br />
					Alas! how hard for me to gain!<br />
					Alas! no easy thing for me to gain!<br />
					in whom disaffection has arisen,<br />
					and lust harasses the heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">How were it possible here and now<br />
					that another<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> should cause me to get rid of this disaffection<br />
					and produce loyal love?</p>

					<p class="f4">What if I were now by myself<br />
					to get rid of my disaffection<br />
					and cause loyal love to arise?'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Vaŋgīsa by himself<br />
					got rid of his disaffection<br />
					and caused loyal love to arise within him.</p>

					<p class="f4">In that hour he uttered these verses: —</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Alas!<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> That now when I am gone from home<br />
					Into the homeless life, these wanton thoughts<br />
					Sprung from the Dark should flit about my mind!<br />
					Were high-born warriors, mighty archers, trained<br />
					In champion bow-craft, such as never flee,<br />
					A thousand, shooting arrows round about —<br />
					But women! ... well, far more than these may come,<br />
					Yet shall they never wreck my peace of mind.<br />
					Firmly established in the Norm<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> I stand.<br />
					For even in his presence have I heard<br />
					The Buddha of the sun's high lineage tell<br />
					About the Path that to Nibbāna goes,<br />
					And there the love of all my heart is given.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span><br />
					Now that I always in such mood abide,<br />
					Dost think, vile one, thou canst draw nigh to me;<br />
					Then shall I act in such wise, Death, that thou<br />
					Wilt ne'er discover which the way I take.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> On the curious legend concerning his profession and conversion, see <i>Pss. of the Brethren,</i> p. 395 <i>f.</i> B. gives it at the last of these Suttas.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Is frequently mentioned in Pali literature. See JPTS., 1888, p. 11; <i>cf. Dhp. Comy.</i> iii, 170; 261 <i>f.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> Or shrine: <i>cetiya. Comy.</i> Probably erected by a pre-Buddhistic cult. See below, X, &sect; 12.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> See <i>Pss. of the Brethren,</i> p. 408 <i>f.; Sn.</i> ver. 342 <i>f.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> It being his first year and he unskilled in the bowl-and-robe usages, the Theras left him to guard sunshades, sandals, and staves, while they went for alms. <i>Comy.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>An-abhirati;</i> 'loyal love' = <i>abhirati,</i> a strong form of <i>rati. Cf.</i> Māra's daughter so-called. IV, 3, &sect; 5: 'Discontent.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> <i>I.e.</i> in the absence of his 'spiritual pastors and masters,' as the <i>Comy.</i> remarks.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> I give the rendering (with three alterations) as in the <i>Pss. of the Brethren,</i> 1209-13, and refer the reader to the notes there. B.'s comments agree with those of the <i>Dhammapāla</i> (pointing to (<i>a</i>) a common source of materials, (<i>b</i>) dependence — see &sect; 2, <i>n.</i> 2), and he, too, fails to make clear the syntax of <i>sahassaŋ apalāyinaŋ,</i> unless it be a genitive absolute. 'Thousand,' however, belongs to the bowmen and not to their arrows, and has been corrected accordingly. 'The best archer,' say he Commentators, 'can only shoot one arrow at a time; women by appealing to the senses shoot five any moment!'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> Not <i>dhammesu,</i> but <i>dhamme su,</i> or <i>so.</i> B. has <i>Sāsanadhamme,</i> 'rule, or Norm of the Teaching,' or 'Church,' as we should say.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> This is the 'loyal' love once more confessed and triumphant. <i>Cf.</i> the <i>rato, abhirato</i> of <i>Pss of the Brethren,</i> ver. 742, and <i>Sisters,</i> vers. 359, 450.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> <i>Cf.</i> Māra's baffled ignorance in IV, 3, &sect; 3; <i>cf.</i> also above, IV, 2. &sect; 9.</p>
