					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p15.1" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/01_sagv/sn01.07.001-022.pali.bd.htm#p15.1">15.1</a>]</span> T<span class="f2"><b>HUS</b></span> H<span class="f2"><b>AVE</b></span> I H<span class="f2"><b>EARD:</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">On one occasion, at Sāvatthi, there was a brahmin living there called Pridestiff.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">He showed respect neither to his mother,<br />
					nor to his father,<br />
					nor to his teacher,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					nor to his eldest brother.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion the Exalted One,<br />
					surrounded by a large congregation,<br />
					was teaching the Norm.</p>

					<p class="f4">And it occurred to the brahmin, Pridestiff:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This Samana Gotama,<br />
					surrounded by a large congregation,<br />
					is teaching the Norm.</p>

					<p class="f4">What if I were to go near?</p>

					<p class="f4">If he will talk to me,<br />
					I will talk to him;<br />
					if not, I will not speak to him.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And he drew near and stood at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One did not speak to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Pridestiff thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This Samana Gotama does not know anything,'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> was fain to turn back again.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One discerning intuitively the thoughts of the brahmin,<br />
					addressed him in the verse: —</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Not well is it to foster pride!<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
							If there be any here,<br />
							Brahmin, for sake of whom thou'rt come,<br />
							Give him thy fostering care.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Pridestiff thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Samana Gotama knows my thoughts!' and there and then he fell on his face at the Exalted One's feet and kissed those feet and stroked them,<br />
					telling his name:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Pridestiff am I, Master Gotama,<br />
					Pridestiff am I, Master Gotama!'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span>

					Then the congregation was astonished, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'0 wonderful, sir!</p>

					<p class="f4">0 astonishing, sir, is it!</p>

					<p class="f4">For this Pridestiff shows respect to neither mother,<br />
					nor father,<br />
					nor teacher,<br />
					nor eldest brother,<br />
					and yet he utterly prostrates himself in this manner before the Samana Gotama.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One said to Pridestiff:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Enough, brahmin, stand up and sit down in thine own place,<br />
					whence belief in me arose in thy heart.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So Pridestiff sat down in his own place and addressed the Exalted One in the verse: —</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">To whom should one show due humility,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Whom treat with reverence?<br />
							Whom should ojne offer honour and respect!<br />
							To worship whom is well?</p>

					<p class="f4">[The Exalted One: —]</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">To mother and to father shouldst thou show<br />
							Humility, to eldest brother too,<br />
							And fourthly to thy teacher: these shouldst thou<br />
							With reverence treat, these honour and respect,<br />
							These worshipfully to entreat is well.<br />
							The Arahants, the Saintly Cool,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> whose work<br />
							Is perfected, and they sane and immune,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
							These peerless ones, docile,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> thy pride subdued,<br />
							In veneration hold.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had thus spoken, Pridestiff, the brahmin, said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Most excellent, Master Gotama, most excellent!</p>

					<p class="f4">As if one raised up that which had been overthrown,<br />
					or revealed that which had been hidden,<br />
					or declared the way to one who was bewildered,<br />
					or carried an oil-lamp into the dark,<br />
					so that they that had eyes could see,<br />
					even so is the Norm in many ways made manifest by Master Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lo! I go for refuge to Gotama the Exalted One,<br />
					to the Norm,<br />
					and to the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">May Master Gotama suffer me as a lay-adherent,<br />
					who from this day forth<br />
					as long as life endures<br />
					has taken in him refuge!'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Cf.</i> above, VII, 1, &sect; 5. Evidently either a nickname: <i>Māna-thaddka</i>, or a mere <i>nom d'occasion. Cf.</i> a similar character in Jenta (<i>Pss. of the Brethren,</i> CCXVIII), the son of Pasenadi's chaplain, and with whom this Pridestiff should have been identified. <i>Dhammapāla</i> describes him as <i>mānthaddo,</i> and gives a similar narrative.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Unsaluted an <i>ācariya</i> (teacher) refused instruction, and, if the discourtesy proceeded from an ex-pupil, recognition. <i>Comy.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> 'In that he takes no notice of a high-bred person like me.' <i>Comy.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> The Burmese MS. of Dhammapāla's <i>Comy.</i> used in <i>op cit.</i> reads:</p>

					<p><i>'Na mānabrūhanaɱ sādhu. Atthāɱ karīyatha, brāhmaṇa,'</i> which is simpler than the reading in Feer's edition, and avoids the doubled <i>brāhmaṇa</i>. But it is otherwise awkward, and is less courteous in tone.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>Cf.</i> VII, 1, &sect; 5, n, 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> The Pali idiom is '(not) make pride.' <i>Cf. Jāt.</i> iv, 388.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> <i>Cf. Pss. of the Brethren,</i> references in Index under 'cool.' Bud* dhism (1912), p. 175; and below, VIII, &sect; 4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>Cf. Pss. of the Brethren</i>, references in Index under 'sane.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> Lit. not-stiff, supple-minded. The Br. MS. is here perhaps the corrupter reading: <i>nihacca mānaɱ atthadvāre,</i> so we follow Feer, and let the pada refer to the brahmin.</p>
