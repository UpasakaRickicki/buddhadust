					<p class="f4">Before I was enlightened, brethren,<br />
					it came to me,<br />
					a Bodhisat yet unenlightened,<br />
					thus: —</p>

					<p class="f4">Alas! this world has fallen upon trouble!</p>

					<p class="f4">There is getting born<br />
					and growing old and dying<br />
					and falling and arising,<br />
					but there is not the knowing<br />
					of an escape from suffering,<br />
					from decay-and-death.</p>

					<p class="f4">O when shall an escape be revealed from suffering,<br />
					from decay-and-death?</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, brethren, this came to me: —</p>

					<p class="f4">What now being,<br />
					does decay-and-death come to be?<br />
					What conditions decay and-death?</p>

					<p class="f4">To me, brethren, thinking according to law<br />

					<p class="f4">Where there is birth,<br />
					decay-and-death comes to be;<br />
					decay-and-death is conditioned by birth.</p>

					<p class="f4">To me, brethren, came this: —</p>

					<p class="f4">'What now being,<br />
					does birth come to be?<br />
					does becoming come to be?<br />

					<p class="f4">To me, brethren, thinking ac- <a id="pg73"><span class="f2 g"><b>[73]</b></span></a> cording to law<br />

					<p class="f4">Where there is name-and-shape,<br />
					there is consciousness;<br />

					<p class="f4">This consciousness turns back,<br />
					it goes no further than name-and-shape.<br />
					Thus far are ye born,<br />
					or grow old,<br />
					or die,<br />
					or fall,<br />

					<p class="f4">Consciousness, namely,<br />

					even such is the coming to be<br />
					of this entire mass of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Coming to be, coming to be!<br />
					at the thought, brethren,<br />
					there arose in me<br />
					concerning things not taught before<br />
					vision,<br />
					knowledge arose,<br />
					insight arose,<br />
					wisdom arose,<br />

					<p class="f4">To me, brethren, came this: —</p>

					From the ceasing of consciousness<br />
					ceases name-and-shape.</p>

					<p class="f4">To me, brethren, came this: —</p>

					<p class="f4">Won have I<br />
					to the path of enlightenment,<br />
					to this,<br />
					that from the ceasing of name-and-shape<br />
					consciousness ceases;<br />
					from the ceasing of consciousness,<br />
					name-and-shape ceases;<br />

					<p class="f4">Even such is the ceasing<br />

					<p class="f4">Ceasing, ceasing!<br />
					At that thought, brethren,<br />
					concerning <a id="pg74"><span class="f2 g"><b>[74]</b></span></a> things not taught before<br />
					there arose in me vision,<br />
					knowledge arose,<br />
					insight arose,<br />
					wisdom arose,<br />
					light arose.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if, brethren,<br />
					a man faring through the forest<br />
					through the great wood<br />
					should see an ancient path,<br />
					an ancient road traversed by men of former days.<br />
					And he were to go along it,<br />
					and going along it he should see an ancient city,<br />
					an ancient prince's domain,<br />
					wherein dwelt men of former days,<br />
					having gardens,<br />
					groves,<br />
					pools,<br />
					foundations of walls,<br />
					a goodly spot.<br />
					And that man, brethren,<br />
					should bring word to the prince<br />
					or to the prince's minister: —</p>

					<p class="f4">'Pardon, lord, know this.<br />
					I have seen as I fared through the forest,<br />
					through the great wood,<br />
					an ancient path,<br />
					an ancient road traversed by men of former days.<br />
					I have been along it,<br />
					and going along it<br />
					I have seen an ancient city,<br />
					an ancient prince's domain,<br />
					wherein dwelt men of former days,<br />
					having gardens,<br />
					groves,<br />
					pools,<br />
					foundations of walls,<br />
					a goodly spot.<br />
					Lord, restore that city.'<br />
					And, brethren,<br />
					the prince or his minister<br />
					should restore that city.<br />
					That city should thereafter<br />
					become prosperous and flourishing,<br />
					populous,<br />
					teeming with folk,<br />
					grown and thriven.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Even so have I, brethren,<br />
					seen an ancient path,<br />
					an ancient road traversed<br />
					by the rightly enlightened ones<br />
					of former times.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, brethren,<br />
					is that ancient path,<br />
					that ancient road<br />
					traversed by the rightly enlightened ones<br />
					of former times?</p>

					<p class="f4">Just this Ariyan eightfold path, to wit,<br />
					right views,<br />
					right aims,<br />
					right speech,<br />
					right action,<br />
					right livelihood,<br />
					right effort,<br />
					right mindfulness,<br />
					right concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brethren, is that ancient path,<br />
					that ancient road,<br />
					traversed by the rightly enlightened ones<br />
					of former times.</p>

					<p class="f4">Along that have I gone,<br />
					<a id="pg75"><span class="f2 g"><b>[75]</b></span></a> and going along it<br />
					I have fully come to know decay-and-death,<br />
					I have fully come to know the uprising of decay-and-death,<br />
					I have fully come to know the ceasing of decay-and-death,<br />
					I have fully come to know the way going to the ceasing of decay-and-death.</p>

					<p class="f4">Along that have I gone,<br />
					and going along it<br />
					I have fully come to know birth,<br />
					yea, and becoming and grasping,<br />
					and craving,<br />
					and feeling,<br />
					and contact,<br />
					and sense,<br />
					and name-and-shape,<br />
					and consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Along that have I gone,<br />
					and going along it<br />
					I have fully come to know activities,<br />
					I have fully come to know the uprising of activities,<br />
					I have fully come to know the ceasing of activities,<br />
					I have fully come to know the way going to the ceasing of activities.</p>

					<p class="f4">This that I have fully come to know<br />
					I have declared to the brethren,<br />
					to the sisters,<br />
					to laymen,<br />
					to laywomen,<br />
					even this divine life, brethren,<br />
					that is prosperous and flourishing,<br />
					widespread,<br />
					and to be known by many,<br />
					and multiplied so far as it is well made manifest<br />
					by devas and men.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Each item in the text is dealt vith in full. See above &sect;10.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> So is Nālandi described, <i>Dialogues,</i> i, 277. In this beautiful Sutta that has the stamp of an <i>ipse dixit</i>, stress, for a special purpose, is laid in my Buddhism. p. 33, on the Teacher not being unique, but in a series. As a whole the Sutta lays stress on the antiquity of the moral instinct, the 'ought,' the Path-law in human nature shown by teachers.<br />
					Here as in the Mahā-Nidāna Suttanta (<i>Dialogues,</i> ii, 51 f.) 'ignorance' and 'activities' are dropped. Why? asks the <i>Comy.</i> 'These belong to a third life.' ... This teaching is concerned with the present. These belong to the causes active in past lives. It is curious that no reference is made to the above-named Sutta, let alone to No. 10 above.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> The <i>Comy.</i> reads not <i>yāvad-eva</i> but <i>yāva deva-.</i> Its paraphrase is 'to be known by many (<i>bahujana viññeyyaŋ</i>) so far as there is the division as to devas and men (<i>deva manussehi paricchedo atthi</i>) in the ten-thousandfold-universe (<i>cakkavā'e</i>) ... well manifested <i>by the Tathāgata</i>' I do not hink for a moment that the Sutta would have omitted <i>Tathāgatena,</i> had this been meant. The Suttas never do so. The success of the divine life is precisely in proportion as devas and men lead it and so manifest it.</p>
