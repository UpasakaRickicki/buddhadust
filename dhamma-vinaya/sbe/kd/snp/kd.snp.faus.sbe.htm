					<h4 class="ctr">INTRODUCTION<br />
					TO<br />
					THE SUTTA-NIPATA</h4>

					<p><span class="f4">T</span><span class="f2"><b>HE</b></span> Collection of Discourses, Sutta-Nipāta, which I have here translated,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> is very remarkable, as there can be no doubt that it contains some remnants of Primitive Buddhism. I consider the greater part of the Mahāvagga, and nearly the whole of the Aṭṭhakavagga as very old. I have arrived at this conclusion from two reasons, first from the language, and secondly from the contents.</p>

					<p>1. We not only find here what we meet with in other Pāli poetry, the fuller Vedic forms of nouns and verbs in the plural, as <i>avītataɱhāse, paṇḍitāse, dhammāse, sitāse, upaṭṭhitāse, pavādiyāse, etc,</i> and <i>karāmase, asmase, sikkhissāmase;</i> the shorter Vedic plurals and the instrumental singular of nouns, as <i>vinikkhayā, lakkhaṇā for vinikkhayāni, lakkhaṇāni, mantā, pariññā, vinayā, lābhakamyā for mantāya, etc;</i> Vedic infinitives, as <i>vippahātave, sampayātave, uṇṇametave;</i> contracted (or sometimes old) forms, as <i>santyā, gakkā, duggakkā, sammukkā, titthyā, thiyo, parihīrati</i> for <i><i>santiyā, gātiyā, sammutiyā, titthiyā, itthiyo, parihariyati,</i></i> by the side of protracted forms, such as <i>ātumānaɱ;</i> but also some unusual (sometimes old) forms and words, as <i>apukkhasi, sagghasi</i><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup> = <i>sakkhissasi, sussaɱ = suṇissāmi (Sansk. <b>s</b>roshyāmi), pāva and pāvā = vadati, pavekkhe = paveseyya, parikissati = parikilissati, vineyya, vikeyya, nikkheyya, pappuyya, = vinayitvā, etc, daṭṭhu = disvā (S. d<b>r</b>ishṭvā), atisitvā = atikkamitvā, anuvikka = anuviditvā, paribbasāna = vasamāna, amhanā (S. asmanā) = pāsāṇena, vākībhi, katubbhi, rattamahābhi, ise (vocative), suvāmi = sāmi, maga = miga, <a id="pgxii"><span class="f2 g"><b>[xii]</b></span></a> tumo = so, parovara = parāvara, bhūnahu = bhūtihanaka, upaya, āmagandha, dhona, vyappatha, vyappathi, vevikkhā, visenibhūta, visenikatvā, paṭiseniyanti.</i></span> Sometimes we meet also with difficult and irregular constructions, and very condensed expressions. All this proves, I think, that these parts of the book are much older than the Suttas in which the language is not only fluent, but of which some verses are even singularly melodious.</p>

					<p>2. In the contents of the Suttanipāta we have, I think, an important contribution to the right understanding of Primitive Buddhism, for we see here a picture not of life in monasteries, but of the life of hermits in its first stage. We have before us not the systematizing of the later Buddhist church, but the first germs of a system, the fundamental ideas of which come out with sufficient clearness. From the Aṭṭhakavagga especially it is evident where Buddha takes his stand in opposition to Philosophy (<i>diṭṭhi = dar<b>s</b>ana</i>).</p>

					<p>Indian society at the time of Buddha had two large and distinguished religious sects, Samaṇas and Brāhmaṇas. This is apparent from several passages where they are mentioned together; for instance, <i>Vinaya,</i> ed. Oldenberg, II, p. 295; Grimblot, <i>Sept Suttas Pālis,</i> p. ix, 8 etc, 118 etc, 158 etc, 306 etc, 309; <i>Dhammapada,</i> p. 392; <i>Suttanipāta;</i> vv. 99, 129, 189, 440, 529, 859, 1078; <i>Sabhiyasutta,</i> at the beginning; the <i>Inscriptions of Asoka; Mahābhāshya</i>, II, 4, 9 (fol. 398 a); <i>Lalita Vistara,</i> pp. 309, l. 10, 318, l. 18, 320, l. 20; and lastly, <i>Megasthenes</i> (Schwanbeck, p. 45), {Greek: <i>dúo génh figodófwn, wn toùs mèn Braxmanas kalei, toùs dè Sarmanas</i>}.</p>

					<p>Famous teachers arose and gathered around them flocks of disciples. As such are mentioned Pūraṇa-Kassapa, Makkhali-Gosāla, Agita-Kesakarnbali, Pakudha-Kakkāyana, Sañgaya-Belaṭṭhiputta, and Niganṭha-Nātaputta<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span>; see Suttanipāta, p. 86; Mahāparinibbānasutta, ed. Childers, p. 58; Vinaya II, p. 111; Grimblot, <i>Sept Suttas Pālis,</i> p. 114, etc; <i>Milindapañha</i>, ed. Trenckner, p. 4. Besides these there is Bāvari (Suttanipāta, p. 184), and his disciples Agita, Tissametteyya, Puññaka, Mettagū, Dhotaka, Upasīva, Nanda, <a id="pgxiii"><span class="f2 g"><b>[xiii]</b></span></a> Hemaka, Todeyya, Kappa, Gatukaṇṇin, Bhadrāvudha, Udaya, Posāla, Mogharāgan (Piŋgiya, vv. 1006-1008; Sela, p. 98), and, Kaŋkin, Tārukkha, Pokkharasāti, Gānussoṇi, Vāseṭṭha, and Bhāradvāga, p. 109.</p>

					<p>We learn that there were four kinds of Samaṇas, viz. Maggaginas, Maggadesakas (or Maggadesins, Maggagghāyins), Maggagīvins, and Maggadūsins, vv. 83-88. Among these Samaṇas disputes arose, vv. 828, 883-884; a number of philosophical systems were formed, and at the time of Buddha there were as many as sixty-three of them, v. 538. These systems are generally designated by <i>diṭṭhi,</i> vv. 54, 151, 786, 837, 851, etc; or by <i>ditthigata,</i> vv. 834, 836, 913; or by <i>diṭhasuta,</i> v. 778; or by <i>diṭṭha, suta,</i> and <i>muta,</i> vv. 793, 813, 914; or by <i>diṭṭha, suta, silavata</i>,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> and <i>muta,</i> vv. 790, 797-798, 836, 887, 1080. The doctrines themselves are called <i>diṭṭhinivesa,</i> v. 785; or <i>nivesana,</i> vv. 209, 470, 801, 846; or <i>vinikkhaya,</i> vv. 838, 866, 887, 894; and he who entertains any of them, is called <i>nivissavādin,</i> vv. 910, 913.</p>

					<p>What is said of the Samaṇas seems mostly to hold good about the Brāhmaṇas also. They too are called disputatious, <i>vādasīla,</i> v. 381, etc, p. 109; and three kinds of them are mentioned, viz. Titthiyas, Āgīvikas, and Nigaṇthas, vv. 380, 891-892. ln contradistinction to the Samaṇas the Brāhmaṇas are designated as Teviggas, vv. 594, 1019; they are Padakas, Veyyākaraṇas, and perfect in Gappa, Nighaṇḍu, Keṭubha, Itihāsa, etc, v. 595, p. 98. They are called friends of the hymns, v. 139; well versed in the hymns, v. 976; and their principal hymn is Sāvitti,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> vv. 568, 456. They worship and make offerings to the fire, pp. 74, 20. In Brāhmaṇadhammikasutta the ancient and just Brāhmaṇas are described in opposition to the later <a id="pgxiv"><span class="f2 g"><b>[xiv]</b></span></a> Brāhmaṇas, who slay innocent cows and have acquired wealth through the favour of the kings. vv. 307, 308, 311, 302.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>All these disputants hold fast to their own prejudiced views, v. 910. They say that purity comes from philosophical views, from tradition, and from virtuous works, and in many other ways, v. 1078, and that there is no bliss excepting by following their opinions, vv. 889, 891, 892.</p>

					<p>Buddha himself has, it is true, sprung from the Samaṇas: he is called Samaṇa Gotama, p. 96; he shines like a sun in the midst of the Samaṇas, v. 550; and intercourse with Samaṇas is said to be the highest blessing, v. 265. But Buddha has overcome all their systems, v. 538; there is nothing which has not been seen, heard, or thought by him, and nothing which has not been understood by him, v. 1121. All the disputatious Brāhmaṇas do not overcome him in understanding, v. 380; and he asserts that no one is purified and saved by philosophy or by virtuous works, vv. 1079, 839. Sanctification, in fact, does not come from another, vv. 773, 790, 813; it can be attained only by going into the yoke with Buddha, v. 834; by believing in him and in the Dhamma of the Saints, vv. 183, 185, 370, 1142; on the whole, by being what Buddha is.</p>

					<p>What then is Buddha?</p>

					<p>First he is a Visionary, in the good sense of the word; his knowledge is intuitive. 'Seeing misery,' he says, 'in the philosophical views, without adopting any of them, searching for truth, I saw inward peace,' vv. 837, 207. And again, 'He, a conqueror unconquered, saw the Dhamma visibly, without any traditional instruction,' vv. 934, 1052, 1065. He teaches an instantaneous, an immediate religious life, vv. 567, 1136. He is called <i>kakkhumat,</i> endowed with an eye, clearly-seeing, vv. 160, 405, 540, 562, 596, 956, 992, 1028, 1115, 1127; <i>samantakakkhu,</i> the all-seeing, vv. 1062, 1068; and as such he has become an eye to the world, v. 599. He sees the subtle meaning of things, vv. 376, 175; he is, in one word, <i>Sambuddha,</i> the perfectly-enlightened, vv. 177, 555, 596, 992; and by knowledge he is delivered, vv. 1106, <a id="pgxv"><span class="f2 g"><b>[xv]</b></span></a> 727, 733. Existence is aviggā, ignorance, v. 729; vigga, knowledge, is the extinction of the world, v. 730.</p>

					<p>Secondly, he is an Ascetic, a <i>Muni</i>,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> one that forsakes the world and wanders from the house to the houseless state, vv. 273, 375, 1003; because from house-life arises defilement, v. 206. An ascetic has no prejudiced ideas, v. 802; he has shaken off every philosophical view, v. 787; he does not enter into disputes, v. 887; he is not pleased nor displeased with anything, v. 813; he is indifferent to learning, v. 911; he does not cling to good and evil, vv. 520, 547, 790; he has cut off all passion and all desire, vv. 2, 795, 1130, 916; he is free from marks, v. 847; and possessionless, <i>akiñkana,</i> vv. 175, 454, 490, 620, 1058, 1062, 976, 1069, 1114. He is equable, v. 855; under all circumstances the same, v. 952; still as the deep water, v. 920; calm, vv. 459, 861. He has reached peace, vv. 837, 845, 919; he knows that bliss consists in peace, v. 933; he has gone to immortal peace, the unchangeable state of <i>Nibbāna,</i> v. 203. And how is this state brought about? By the destruction of consciousness, vv. 734-735. And how does consciousness cease? By the cessation of sensation, vv. 1109-1110; by being without breathing, vv. 1089-1090.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>1. What then is sin according to Buddha?</p>

					<p>Subjectively sin is desire, in all its various forms, vv. 923, 1103; viz. desire tor existence generally, vv. 776, 1059, 1067, and especially for name and form, i.e. individual existence, vv. 354, 1099. As long as man is led by desire he will be whirled about in existence, v. 740; for as long as there is birth, there will be death, v. 742. Existence is called the stream of death, v. 354; the realm of Māra, vv. 164, 1145. Those who continually go to <i>saɱsāra</i> with birth and death, are the ignorant, v. 729. <a id="pgxvi"><span class="f2 g"><b>[xvi]</b></span></a> But desire originates in the body, vv. 270, 1099; sin lies objectively in embodiment or matter, and consequently the human body is looked upon as a contemptible thing. See Vigayasutta, p. 32.</p>

					<p>2. And what is bliss?</p>

					<p>Subjectively, it is emancipation from desire by means of the peace that Buddha preaches, vv. 1065-1066, 1069, 1084, 1108, 838-839.</p>

					<p>Objectively, it is emancipation from body and matter. One must destroy the elements of existence, <i>upadhī,</i> vv. 373, 546, 1050, 1056; and leave the body behind, that one may not come to exist again, vv. 1120, 1122, 761. The ignorant only create <i>upadhi,</i> v. 1050, and go again and again to <i>saɱsāra,</i> v. 729. The wise do not enter time, <i>kappa,</i> vv. 521, 535, 860; they look upon the world as void, v. 1118; hold that there is nothing really existing, v. 1069; and those whose minds are disgusted with a future existence, the wise who have destroyed their seeds (of existence), go out like a lamp, vv. 234, 353-354. As a flame, blown about by the violence of the wind, goes out, and cannot be reckoned (as existing), even so a <i>Muni,</i> delivered from name and body, disappears, and cannot be reckoned (as existing), v. 1073. For him who has disappeared, there is no form; that by which they say he is, exists for him no longer, v. 1075.</p>

					<p>'Exert thyself, then, O Dhotaka,' — so said Bhagavat, — 'being wise and thoughtful in this world, let one, having listened to my utterance, learn his own extinction,' v. 1061.</p>

					<p class="ctr">A dialogue between the rich herdsman Dhaniya and Buddha, the one rejoicing in his worldly security and the other in his religious belief. — This beautiful dialogue calls to mind the parable in the Gospel of S.Luke xii.16.</p>

					<p class="f4">1. 'I have boiled (my) rice, I have milked (my cows),' — so said the herdsman Dhaniya, — 'I am living together with my fellows near the banks of the Mahī (river), (my) house is covered, the fire is kindled: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!' (18)</p>

					<p class="f4">2. 'I am free from anger, free from stubbornness,' — so said Bhagavat, — 'I am abiding for one night near the banks of the Mahī (river), my house <a id="pg4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[4]</b></span></a> is uncovered, the fire (of passions) is extinguished: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!' (19)</p>

					<p class="f4">3. 'Gad-flies are not to be found (with me),' — so said the herdsman Dhaniya, — 'in meadows abounding with grass the cows are roaming, and they can endure rain when it comes: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!' (20)</p>

					<p class="f4">4. '(By me) is made a well-constructed raft,' — so said Bhagavat, — 'I have passed over (to Nibbāna), I have reached the further bank, having overcome the torrent (of passions); there is no (further) use for a raft: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!' (21)</p>

					<p class="f4">5. 'My wife is obedient, not wanton,' — so said the herdsman Dhaniya, — 'for a long time she has been living together (with me), she is winning, and I hear nothing wicked of her: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!' (22)</p>

					<p class="f4">6. 'My mind is obedient, delivered (from all worldliness),' — so said Bhagavat, — 'it has for a long time been highly cultivated and well-subdued, there is no longer anything wicked in me: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!' (23)</p>

					<p class="f4">7. 'I support myself by my own earnings,' — so said the herdsman Dhaniya, — 'and my children are (all) about me, healthy; I hear nothing wicked of them: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!' (24)</p>

					<p class="f4">8. 'I am no one's servant,' — so said Bhagavat, — 'with what I have gained I wander about in all the world, there is no need (for me) to serve: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!' (25)</p>

					<p class="f4">9. 'I have cows, I have calves,' —  so said the herdsman Dhaniya; — 'I have cows in calf and heifers, and I have also a bull as lord over the cows: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!' (26)</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg5"><span class="f2 g"><b>[5]</b></span></a> 10. 'I have no cows, I have no calves,' — so said Bhagavat, — 'I have no cows in calf and no heifers, and I have no bull as a lord over the cows: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky! (27)</p>

					<p class="f4">11. 'The stakes are driven in, and cannot be shaken,' — so said the herdsman Dhaniya, — 'the ropes are made of munga grass, new and well-made, the cows will not be able to break them: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!' (28)</p>

					<p class="f4">12. 'Having, like a bull, rent the bonds; having, like an elephant, broken through the galukkhi creeper, I shall not again enter into a womb: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!' (29)</p>

					<p class="f4">Then at once a shower poured down, filling both sea and land. Hearing the sky raining, Dhaniya spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">13. 'No small gain indeed (has accrued) to us since we have seen Bhagavat; we take refuge in thee, O (thou who art) endowed with the eye (of wisdom); be thou our master, O great Muni!' (30)</p>

					<p class="f4">14. 'Both my wife and myself are obedient; (if) we lead a holy life before Sugata, we shall conquer birth and death, and put an end to pain.' (31)</p>

					<p class="f4">15. 'He who has sons has delight in sons,' — so said the wicked Māra, — 'he who has cows has delight likewise in cows; for upadhi (substance) is the delight of man, but he who has no upadhi has no delight.' (32)</p>

					<p class="f4">16. 'He who has sons has care with (his) sons,' — so said Bhagavat, — 'he who has cows has likewise care with (his) cows; for upadhi (is the cause of) people's cares, but he who has no upadhi has no care.' (33)</p>

					<p class="ctr">Family life and intercourse with others should be avoided, for society has all vices in its train; therefore one should leave the corrupted state of society and lead a solitary life.</p>

					<p class="ctr">The Brāhmaṇa Kasibhāradvāga reproaches Gotama with idleness, but the latter convinces him that he (Buddha) also works, and so the Brāhmaṇa is converted, and finally becomes a saint.<br />
					Compare Sp. Hardy, A Manual of Buddhism, p. 214; Gospel of S. John v. 17.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it was heard by me:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time Bhagavat dwelt in Magadha at Dakkhiṇāgiri in the Brāmana village Ekanaḷā. And at that time the Brāmaṇa Kasibhāradvāga's five hundred <a id="pg12"><span class="f2 g"><b>[12]</b></span></a> ploughs were tied (to the yokes) in the sowing season. Then Bhagavat, in the morning, having put on his raiment and taken his bowl and robes, went to the place where the Brāmaṇa Kasibhāradvāga's work (was going on). At that time the Brāmaṇa Kasibhāradvāga's distribution of food took place. Then Bhagavat went to the place where the distribution of food took place, and having gone there, he stood apart. The Brāmaṇa Kasibhāradvāga saw Bhagavat standing there to get alms, and having seen him, he said this to Bhagavat:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I, O Samaṇa, both plough and sow, and having ploughed and sown, I eat; thou also, O Samaṇa, shouldst plough and sow, and having ploughed and sown, thou shouldst eat.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I also, O Brāmaṇa, both plough and sow, and having ploughed and sown, I eat,' so said Bhagavat.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yet we do not see the yoke, or the plough, or the ploughshare, or the goad, or the oxen of the venerable Gotama.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And then the venerable Gotama spoke in this way:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I also, O Brāmaṇa, both plough and sow, and having ploughed and sown, I eat,' so said Bhagavat.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Brāmaṇa Kasibharadvaga addressed Bhagavat in a stanza:</p>

					<p class="f4">1. 'Thou professest to be a ploughman, and yet we do not see thy ploughing; asked about (thy) ploughing, tell us (of it), that we may know thy ploughing.' (75)</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Bhagavat answered: 'Faith is the seed, penance the rain, understanding my yoke and plough, modesty the pole of the plough, mind the tie, thoughtfulness my ploughshare and goad. (76)</p>

					<p class="f4">3. 'I am guarded in respect of the body, I am <a id="pg13"><span class="f2 g"><b>[13]</b></span></a> guarded in respect of speech, temperate in food; I make truth to cut away (weeds), tenderness is my deliverance. (77)</p>

					<p class="f4">4. 'Exertion is my beast of burden; carrying (me) to Nibbāna he goes without turning back to the place where having gone one does not grieve. (78)</p>

					<p class="f4">5. 'So this ploughing is ploughed, it bears the fruit of immortality; having ploughed this ploughing one is freed from all pain.' (79)</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Brāmaṇa Kasibhāradvāga, having poured rice-milk into a golden bowl, offered it to Bhagavat, saying, 'Let the venerable Bhagavat eat of the rice-milk; the venerable is a ploughman, for the venerable Gotama ploughs a ploughing that bears the fruit of immortality.'</p>

					<p class="f4">6. Bhagavat said: 'What is acquired by reciting stanzas is not to be eaten by me; this is, O Brāmaṇa, not the Dhamma of those that see rightly; Buddha rejects what is acquired by reciting stanzas, this is the conduct (of Buddhas) as long as the Dhamma exists. (80)</p>

					<p class="f4">'To whom then, O Gotama, shall I give this rice-milk?' so said Kasibhāradvāga.</p>

					<p class="f4">'I do not see, O Brāmaṇa, in the world (of men) <a id="pg14"><span class="f2 g"><b>[14]</b></span></a> and gods and Māras and Brahmans, amongst beings comprising gods and men, and Samaṇas and Brāmaṇas, any by whom this rice-milk when eaten can be properly digested with the exception of Tathāgata, or a disciple of Tathāgata. Therefore, O Brāmaṇa, thou shalt throw this rice-milk in (a place where there is) little grass, or cast it into water with no worms: so said Bhagavat.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Brāmaṇa Kasibhāradvāga threw the rice-milk into some water with no worms. Then the rice-milk thrown into the water splashed, hissed, smoked in volumes; for as a ploughshare that has got hot during the day when thrown into the water splashes, hisses, and smokes in volumes, even so the rice-milk (when) thrown into the water splashed, hissed, and smoked in volumes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Brāmaṇa Kasibhāradvāga alarmed and terrified went up to Bhagavat, and after having approached and fallen with his head at Bhagavat's feet, he said this to Bhagavat:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is excellent, O venerable Gotama! It is excellent, O venerable Gotama! As one raises what has been overthrown, or reveals what has been hidden, or tells the way to him who has gone astray, or holds out an oil lamp in the dark that those who have eyes may see the objects, even so by the venerable Gotama in manifold ways the Dhamma (has been) illustrated. I take refuge in the venerable Gotama and in the Dhamma and in the Assembly of Bhikkhus; I wish to receive the <i>pabbaggā,</i> I wish to receive the upasampada (the robe and the orders) from the venerable Gotama,' so said Kasibharadvaga.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Brāmaṇa Kasibhāradvāga received the <a id="pg15"><span class="f2 g"><b>[15]</b></span></a> <i>pabbaggā</i> from Bhagavat, and he received also the <i>upasampadā;</i> and the venerable Bhāradvāga having lately received the <i>upasampadā;</i>, leading a solitary, retired, strenuous, ardent, energetic life, lived after having in a short time in this existence by his own understanding ascertained and possessed himself of that highest perfection of a religious life for the sake of which men of good family rightly wander, away from their houses to houseless state. 'Birth had been destroyed, a religious life had been led, what was to be done had been done, there was nothing else (to be done) for this existence,' so he perceived, and the venerable Bhāradvāga became one of the arahats (saints).</p>

					<p class="f4">So it was heard by me:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time Bhagavat dwelt at Sāvatthī, in Getavana, in the park of Anāthapiṇḍika. Then Bhagavat having put on his raiment in the morning, and having taken his bowl and his robes, entered Sāvatthī for alms. Now at that time in the house of the Brāmaṇa Aggikabhāradvāga the fire was blazing, the offering brought forth. Then Bhagavat going for alms from house to house in Sāvatthī went to the house of the Brāmaṇa Aggikabhāradvāga. The Brāmaṇa Aggikabhāradvāga saw Bhagavat coming at a distance, and seeing him he said this: 'Stay there, O Shaveling; (stay) there, O Samaṇaka (i.e. wretched Samaṇa); (stay) there, O Vasalaka (i.e. outcast)!'</p>

					<p class="f4">This having been said, Bhagavat replied to the Brāmaṇa Aggikabhāradvāga: 'Dost thou know, O Brāmaṇa, an outcast, or the things that make an outcast?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'No, O venerable Gotama, I do not know an outcast, or the things that make an outcast; let the venerable Gotama teach me this so well that I may know an outcast, or the things that make an outcast."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Listen then, O Brāmaṇa, attend carefully, I will tell (thee).'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, O venerable one,' so the Brāmaṇa Aggikabhāradvāga replied to Bhagavat.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg21"><span class="f2 g"><b>[21]</b></span></a> Then Bhagavat said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">2. 'Whosoever in this world harms living beings, whether once or twice born, and in whom there is no compassion for living beings, let one know him as an outcast. (116)</p>

					<p class="f4">22. 'Know ye this in the way that this example of mine (shows): There was a Kaṇḍāla of the Sopāka caste, well known as Mātaŋga. (136)</p>

					<p class="f4">23. 'This Mātaŋga. reached the highest fame, such as was very difficult to obtain, and many Khattiyas and Brāmaṇas went to serve him. (137)</p>

					<p class="ctr">The Yakkha Āḷavaka first threatens Buddha, then puts some questions to him which Buddha answers, whereupon Āḷavaka is converted.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it was heard by me:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time Bhagavat dwelt at Āḷavi, in the realm of the Yakkha Āḷavaka. Then the Yakkha Āḷavaka went to the place where Bhagavat dwelt, and having gone there he said this to Bhagavat:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come out, O Samaṇa!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, O friend!' so saying Bhagavat came out.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Enter, O Samaṇa!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, O friend!' so saying Bhagavat entered.</p>

					<p class="f4">A second time the Yakkha Āḷavaka said this to Bhagavat:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come out, O Samaṇa!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, O friend!' so saying Bhagavat came out.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Enter, O Samaṇa!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, O friend!' so saying Bhagavat entered.</p>

					<p class="f4">A third time the Yakkha Āḷavaka said this Bhagavat:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come out, O Samaṇa!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, O friend!' so saying Bhagavat came out.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Enter, O Samaṇa!'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg30"><span class="f2 g"><b>[30]</b></span></a> 'Yes, O friend!' so saying Bhagavat entered.</p>

					<p class="f4">A fourth time the Yakkha Āḷavaka said this to Bhagavat:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come out, O Samaṇa!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I shall not come out to thee, O friend, do what thou pleasest.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I shall ask thee a question, O Samaṇa, if thou canst not answer it, I will either scatter thy thoughts or cleave thy heart, or take thee by thy feet and throw thee over to the other shore of the Ganga.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I do not see, O friend, any one in this world nor in the world of gods, Māras, Brahmans, amongst the beings comprising gods, men, Samaṇas, and Brāhmaṇas, who can either scatter my thoughts or cleave my heart, or take me by the feet and throw me over to the other shore of the Ganga; however, O friend, ask what thou pleasest.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Yakkha Āḷavaka addressed Bhagavat in stanzas:</p>

					<p class="f4">1. 'What in this world is the best property for a man? what, being well done, conveys happiness? what is indeed the sweetest of sweet things? how lived do they call life the best?' (180)</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Bhagavat said: 'Faith is in this world the best property for a man; Dhamma, well observed, conveys happiness; truth indeed is the sweetest of things; and that life they call the best which is lived with understanding.' (181)</p>

					<p class="f4">3. Āḷavaka said: 'How does one cross the stream (of existence)? how does one cross the sea? how does one conquer pain? how is one purified?' (182)</p>

					<p class="f4">4. Bhagavat said: 'By faith one crosses the stream, by zeal the sea, by exertion one conquers pain, by understanding one is purified.' (183)</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg31"><span class="f2 g"><b>[31]</b></span></a> 5. Āḷavaka said: 'How does one obtain understanding? how does one acquire wealth? how does one obtain fame? how does one bind friends (to himself)? how does one not grieve passing away from this world to the other?' (184)</p>

					<p class="f4">6. Bhagavat said: 'He who believes in the Dhamma of the venerable ones as to the acquisition of Nibbāna, will obtain understanding from his desire to hear, being zealous and discerning. (185)</p>

					<p class="f4">7. 'He who does what is proper, who takes the yoke (upon him and) exerts himself, will acquire wealth, by truth he will obtain fame, and being charitable he will bind friends (to himself). (186)</p>

					<p class="f4">8. 'He who is faithful and leads the life of a householder, and possesses the following four Dhammas (virtues), truth, justice (dhamma), firmness, and liberality, — such a one indeed does not grieve when passing away. (187)</p>

					<p class="f4">9. 'Pray, ask also other Samaṇas and Brāhmaṇas far and wide, whether there is found in this world anything greater than truth, self-restraint, liberality, and forbearance.' (188)</p>

					<p class="f4">10. Āḷavaka said: 'Why should I now ask Samaṇas and Brāhmaṇas far and wide? I now know what is my future good. (189)</p>

					<p class="f4">11. 'For my good Buddha came to live at Āḷavi; now I know where (i.e. on whom bestowed) a gift will bear great fruit. (190)</p>

					<p class="f4">12. 'I will wander about from village to village, from town to town, worshipping the perfectly enlightened (sambuddha) and the perfection of the Dhamma.' (191)</p>

					<p class="f4">1. If either walking or standing, sitting or lying, any one contracts (or) stretches (his body, then) this is the motion of the body. (192)</p>

					<p class="f4">1. From acquaintanceship arises fear, from house-life arises defilement; the houseless state, freedom from acquaintanceship — this is indeed the view of a Muni. (206)</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg34"><span class="f2 g"><b>[34]</b></span></a> the solitarily wandering they call a Muni; such a great Isi has seen the state of peace<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn25" href="#n25">25</a>]</sup></span>. (207)</p>

					<p class="f4">7. The Muni that wanders solitarily, the zealous,</p>

					<p class="f4">8. Whosoever becomes firm as the post in a bathing-place, in whom others acknowledge propriety of speech, who is free from passion, and (endowed) with well-composed senses, such a one the wise style a Muni. (213)</p>

					<p class="f4">9. Whosoever is firm, like a straight shuttle, and is disgusted with evil actions, reflecting on what is just and unjust, him the wise style a Muni. (214)</p>

					<p class="f4">10. Whosoever is self-restrained and does not do evil, is a young or middle-aged Muni, self-subdued, one that should not be provoked (as) he does not provoke any, him the wise style a Muni. (215)</p>

					<p class="f4">11. Whosoever, living upon what is given by others, receives a lump of rice from the top, from the middle or from the rest (of the vessel, and) does not praise (the giver) nor speak harsh words, him the wise style a Muni. (216)</p>

					<p class="f4">12. The Muni that wanders about abstaining from sexual intercourse, who in his youth is not fettered in any case, is abstaining from the insanity of pride, liberated, him the wise style a Muni. (217)</p>

					<p class="f4">14. Two whose mode of life and occupation are quite different, are not equal: a householder maintaining a wife, and an unselfish virtuous man. A householder (is intent) upon the destruction of <a id="pg36"><span class="f2 g"><b>[36]</b></span></a> other living creatures, being unrestrained; but a Muni always protects living creatures, being restrained.

					<p class="ctr">The Yakkha Sūkiloma threatens to harm Buddha, if he cannot answer his questions. Buddha answers that all passions proceed from the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it was heard by me:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time Bhagavat dwelt at Gaya (seated) on a stone seat in the realm of the Yakkha Sūkiloma. And at that time the Yakkha Khara and the Yakkha Sūkiloma passed by, not far from Bhagavat. And then the Yakkha Khara said this to the Yakkha Sūkiloma: 'Is this man a Samaṇa?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhagavat answered:</p>

					<p class="ctr">Wealthy Brāhmaṇas come to Buddha, asking about the customs of the ancient Brāhmaṇas. Buddha describes their mode of life and the change wrought in them by seeing the king's riches, and furthermore, how they induced the king to commit the sin of <a id="pg48"><span class="f2 g"><b>[48]</b></span></a> having living creatures slain at sacrifices. On hearing Buddha's enlightened discourse the wealthy Brāhmaṇas are converted. Compare Sp. Hardy's <i>Legends,</i> p. 46.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it was heard by me:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time Bhagavat dwelt at Sāvatthī, in Getavana, in the park of Anāthapiṇḍika. Then many wealthy Brāhmaṇas of Kosala, decrepit, elderly, old, advanced in age, or arrived at extreme old age, went to Bhagavat, and having gone to him they talked pleasantly with him, and after having had some pleasant and remarkable talk with him, they sat down apart. Sitting down apart these wealthy Brāhmaṇas said this to Bhagavat: 'O venerable Gotama, are the Brāhmaṇas now-a-days seen (engaged) in the Brāhmanical customs (dhamma) of the ancient Brāhmaṇas?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhagavat answered:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Brāhmaṇas now-a-days, O Brāhmaṇas, are not seen (engaged) in the Brāhmanical customs of the ancient Brāhmaṇas.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The Brāhmaṇas said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let the venerable Gotama tell us the Brāhmanical customs of the ancient Brāhmaṇas, if it is not inconvenient to the venerable Gotama.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhagavat answered:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then listen, O Brāhmaṇas, pay great attention, I will speak.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes,' so saying the wealthy Brāhmaṇas listened to Bhagavat.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhagavat said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">1. The old sages <i>(isayo)</i> were self-restrained, penitent; having abandoned the objects of the five senses, they studied their own welfare. (283)</p>

					<p class="f4">2. There were no cattle for the Brāhmaṇas, nor gold, nor corn, (but) the riches and corn of meditation were for them, and they kept watch over the best treasure. (284)</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg49"><span class="f2 g"><b>[49]</b></span></a> 3. What was prepared for them and placed as food at the door, they thought was to be given to those that seek for what has been prepared by faith. (285)</p>

					<p class="f4">4. With garments variously coloured, with beds and abodes, prosperous people from the provinces and the whole country worshipped those Brāhmaṇas. (286)</p>

					<p class="f4">5. Inviolable were the Brāhmaṇas, invincible, protected by the Dhamma, no one opposed them (while standing) at the doors of the houses anywhere. (287)</p>

					<p class="f4">6. For forty-eight years they practised juvenile chastity, the Brāhmaṇas formerly went in search of science and exemplary conduct. (288)</p>

					<p class="f4">7. The Brāhmaṇas did not marry (a woman belonging to) another (caste), nor did they buy a wife; they chose living together in mutual love after having come together. (289)</p>

					<p class="f4">8. Excepting from the time about the cessation of the menstruation else the Brāhmaṇas did not indulge in sexual intercourse.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn35" href="#n35">35</a>]</sup></span> (290)</p>

					<p class="f4">9. They praised chastity and virtue, rectitude, mildness, penance, tenderness, compassion, and patience. (291)</p>

					<p class="f4">10. He who was the best of them, a strong Brāhmaṇa, did not (even) in sleep indulge in sexual intercourse. (292)</p>

					<p class="f4">11. Imitating his practices some wise men in this world praised chastity and patience. (293)</p>

					<p class="f4">12. Having asked for rice, beds, garments, butter. and oil, and gathered them justly, they made sacrifices <a id="pg50"><span class="f2 g"><b>[50]</b></span></a> out of them, and when the sacrifice came on, they did not kill cows. (294)</p>

					<p class="f4">13. Like unto a mother, a father, a brother, and other relatives the cows are our best friends, in which medicines are produced. (295)</p>

					<p class="f4">14. They give food, and they give strength, they likewise give (a good) complexion and happiness; knowing the real state of this, they did not kill cows. (296)</p>

					<p class="f4">15. They were graceful, large, handsome, renowned, Brāhmaṇas by nature, zealous for their several works; as long as they lived in the world, this race prospered. (297)</p>

					<p class="f4">16. But there was a change in them: after gradually seeing the king's prosperity and adorned women, (298)</p>

					<p class="f4">17. Well-made chariots drawn by noble horses, carpets in variegated colours, palaces and houses, divided into compartments and measured out, (299)</p>

					<p class="f4">18. The great human wealth, attended with a number of cows, and combined with a flock of beautiful women, the Brāhmaṇas became covetous. (300)</p>

					<p class="f4">19. They then, in this matter, having composed hymns, went to Okkāka, and said: 'Thou hast much wealth and corn, sacrifice thy great property, sacrifice thy great wealth.' (301)</p>

					<p class="f4">20. And then the king, the lord of chariots, instructed by the Brāhmaṇas, brought about <i>assamedha, purisamedha, sammāpāsa,</i> and <i>vākāpeyya</i> without any hindrance, and having offered these sacrifices he gave the Brāhmaṇas wealth: (302)</p>

					<p class="f4">21. Cows, beds, garments, and adorned women, and well-made chariots, drawn by noble horses, carpets in variegated colours, (303)</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg51"><span class="f2 g"><b>[51]</b></span></a> 22. Beautiful palaces, well divided into compartments; and having filled these with different (sorts of) corn, he gave this wealth to the Brāhmaṇas. (304)</p>

					<p class="f4">23. And they having thus received wealth wished for a store, and the desire of those who had given way to (their) wishes increased still more; they then, in this matter, having composed hymns, went again to Okkāka, and said: (305)</p>

					<p class="f4">24. 'As water, earth, gold, wealth, and corn, even so are there cows for men, for this is a requisite for living beings; sacrifice thy great property, sacrifice thy wealth.' (306)</p>

					<p class="f4">25. And then the king, the lord of chariots, instructed by the Brāhmaṇas, caused many hundred thousand cows to be slain in offerings. (307)</p>

					<p class="f4">26. The cows, that are like goats, do not hurt any one with their feet or with either of their horns, they are tender, and yield vessels (of milk), — seizing them by the horns the king caused them to be slain with a weapon. (308)</p>

					<p class="f4">27. Then the gods, the forefathers, Inda, the Asuras, and the Rakkhasas cried out: 'This is injustice,' because of the weapon falling on the cows. (309)</p>

					<p class="f4">28. There were formerly three diseases: desire, hunger, and decay, but from the slaying of cattle there came ninety-eight. (310)</p>

					<p class="f4">29. This injustice of (using) violence that has come down (to us), was old; innocent (cows) are slain, the sacrificing (priests) have fallen off from the Dhamma. (311)</p>

					<p class="f4">30. So this old and mean Dhamma is blamed by the wise; where people see such a one, they blame the sacrificing priest. (312)</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg52"><span class="f2 g"><b>[52]</b></span></a> 31. So Dhamma being lost, the Suddas and the Vessikas disagreed, the Khattiyas disagreed in manifold ways, the wife despised her husband. (313)</p>

					<p class="f4">32. The Khattiyas and the Brāhmaṇas and those others who had been protected by their castes, after doing away with their disputes on descent, fell into the power of sensual pleasures. (314)</p>

					<p class="f4">This having been said, those wealthy Brāhmaṇas said to Bhagavat as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is excellent, O venerable Gotama! It is excellent, O venerable Gotama! As one raises what has been overthrown, or reveals what has been hidden, or tells the way to him who has gone astray, or holds out an oil lamp in the dark that those who have eyes may see the objects, even so by the venerable Gotama in manifold ways the Dhamma has been illustrated; we take refuge in the venerable Gotama, in the Dhamma, and in the Assembly of Bhikkhus; may the venerable Gotama receive us as followers (upasaka), who from this day for life have taken refuge (in him).'</p>

					<p class="f4">6. As one, having gone on board a strong ship, provided with oars and rudder, carries across in it many others, knowing the way to do it, and being expert and thoughtful, (320)</p>

					<p class="f4">7. So also he who is accomplished, of a cultivated mind, learned, intrepid, makes others endowed with attention and assiduity understand it, knowing (it himself). (321)</p>

					<p class="ctr">Vaŋgīsa desires to know the fate of Nigrodhakappa, whether he has been completely extinguished, or whether he is still with some elements of existence left behind. He is answered by Buddha.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it was heard by me:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time Bhagavat dwelt at Aḷavī, in the temple of Aggāḷava. At that time the teacher of the venerable Vaŋgīsa, the Thera, by name Nigrodhakappa, had attained bliss not long before <i>(akiraparinibbuta)</i>. Then this reflection occurred to the venerable Vaŋgīsa, while retired and meditating:</p>

					<p class="f4">Whether my teacher be blessed <i>(parinibbuta)</i> or whether he be not blessed. Then the venerable Vaŋgīsa, at the evening time, coming forth from his retirement went to Bhagavat, and having gone to him he sat down apart after saluting him, and sitting down apart the venerable Vaŋgīsa said this to Bhagavat:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, while retired and meditating, this reflection occurred to me here: Whether my teacher be blessed or whether he be not blessed.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Vaŋgīsa, rising from his seat, throwing his robe over one shoulder and bending his joined hands towards Bhagavat, addressed him in stanzas:</p>

					<p class="f4">1. 'We ask the Master of excellent understanding: he who in this world had cut off doubt, died at Aggāḷava, a Bhikkhu, well known, famous, and of a calm mind. (342)</p>

					<p class="f4">2. 'The name "Nigrodhakappa" was given to that Brāhmaṇa by thee, O Bhagavat; he wandered <a id="pg58"><span class="f2 g"><b>[58]</b></span></a> about worshipping thee, having liberation in view, strong, and seeing Nibbāna. (343)</p>

					<p class="ctr">On well-spoken language.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it was heard by me:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time Bhagavat dwelt at Sāvatthī in Getavana. Bhagavat said this: 'O Bhikkhus, the speech that is provided with four requisites is well-spoken, not ill-spoken, both faultless and blameless to the wise.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Which four?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'O Bhikkhus, the Bhikkhu speaks well-spoken (language), not ill-spoken; he speaks what is right (dhamma), not what is unrighteous (adhamma); he speaks what is pleasing, not what is unpleasing; he speaks what is true, not what is false. O Bhikkhus, the speech that is provided with these four requisites, is well-spoken, not ill-spoken, both faultless <a id="pg73"><span class="f2 g"><b>[73]</b></span></a> and blameless to the wise.' This said Bhagavat. When Sugata had said this, then the Master spoke the following:</p>

					<p class="f4">1. 'Well-spoken language the just call the principal (thing); let one speak what is right (dhamma), not what is unrighteous (adhamma), that is the second; let one speak what is pleasing, not what is unpleasing, that is the third; let one speak what is true, not what is false, that is the fourth.' (449)</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Vangisa, rising from his seat, throwing his robe over one shoulder and bending his joined hands towards Bhagavat, said this: 'It occurs to me, O Sugata!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let it occur to thee, O Vangisa!' said Bhagavat.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Vangisa, standing before Bhagavat, praised him with appropriate stanzas:</p>

					<p class="f4">2. 'Let one say such words by which he does not pain himself, nor hurt others; such words are truly well-spoken. (450)</p>

					<p class="f4">3. 'Let one speak pleasing words which are received joyfully (by all), and which (saying) he, without committing sins, speaks what is pleasing to others. (451)</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="ctr">Buddha shows to Sundarikabhāradvāga on whom to bestow oblations, and the Brāmaṇa is finally converted.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it was heard by me:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time Bhagavat dwelt in Kosala on the bank of the river Sundarika. And during that time the Brāmaṇa Sundarikabhāradvāga made offerings to the fire and worshipped the fire. Then the Brāmaṇa Sundarikabhāradvāga, having made offerings to the fire and worshipped the fire, and having risen from his seat, looked about him on all sides towards the four quarters of the globe, saying: 'Who is to enjoy the rest of this oblation?' The Brāmaṇa Sundarikabhāradvāga saw Bhagavat sitting not far off at the root of a tree, wrapped up head and body; and seeing him he, after taking the rest of the oblation with his left hand and the waterpot with his right hand, went up to Bhagavat. Then Bhagavat, on hearing the footsteps of Sundarikabhāradvāga, the Brāmaṇa, uncovered his head. Then the Brāmaṇa Sundarikabhāradvāga thought: 'This man is shaved, this man is a shaveling,' and he wished to return again from there. Then this came to the mind of Sundarikabhāradvāga, the Brāmaṇa: 'Some Brāmaṇas also here are shaved, I think I shall go up and ask him about his descent.' Then the Brāmaṇa Sundarikabhāradvāga went up to Bhagavat, and having gone up he said this: 'Of what family art thou?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Bhagavat answered Sundarikabhāradvāga, the Brāmaṇa, in stanzas:</p>

					<p class="f4">1. 'No Brāmaṇa am I, nor a king's son, nor any <a id="pg75"><span class="f2 g"><b>[75]</b></span></a> Vessa; having thoroughly observed the class of common people, I wander about the world reflectingly, possessing nothing. (454)</p>

					<p class="f4">2. 'Dressed in a <i>sanghātī</i><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn50" href="#n50">50</a>]</sup></span> and houseless I wander about, with my hair cut off, calm, not intermixing with people in this world. Thou askest me an unseasonable question about (my) family, O Brāhmaṇa!' (455)</p>

					<p class="f4">3. Sundarikabhāradvāga: 'Sir, Brāmaṇas together with Brāmaṇas ask truly, Art thou a Brāhmaṇa?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhagavat: 'If thou sayest, I am a Brāmaṇa, and callest me no Brāmaṇa, then I ask thee about the Sāvittī that consists of three padas and twenty-four syllables<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn51" href="#n51">51</a>]</sup></span>.' (456)</p>

					<p class="f4">4. Sundarikabhāradvāga: 'For what (reason) did the Isis, men, Khattiyas, Brāmaṇas make offerings to the gods abundantly in this world?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhagavat: 'He who, perfect and accomplished at the time of offering, obtains the ear of one or the other (god), he will succeed, so I say.' (457)</p>

					<p class="f4">5. 'Surely his offering will bear fruit,' — so said the Brāmaṇa, — 'because we saw such an accomplished man; for by not seeing such as you, somebody else will enjoy the oblation.' (458)</p>

					<p class="f4">6. Bhagavat: 'Therefore, O Brāmaṇa, as you have come here to ask for something, ask; perhaps thou mightest here find one that is calm, without anger, free from pain, free from desire, one with a good understanding.' (459)</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg76"><span class="f2 g"><b>[76]</b></span></a></p>

					<p class="f4">7. Sundarikabhāradvāga: 'I delight in offering, O Gotama, I desire to make an offering, but I do not understand it; do thou instruct me, tell me in what case the offering succeeds.' (460)</p>

					<p class="f4">8. Bhagavat: 'Therefore, O Brāmaṇa, lend me thy ear, I will teach thee the Dhamma. (461)</p>

					<p class="f4">9. 'Do not ask about descent, but ask about conduct; from wood, it is true, fire is born; (likewise) a firm Muni, although belonging to a low family, may become noble, when restrained (from sinning) by humility. (462)</p>

					<p class="f4">10. 'He who is subdued by truth, endowed with temperance, accomplished, leading a religious life, on such a one in due time people should bestow oblations; let the Brāmaṇa who has good works in view, offer. (463)</p>

					<p class="f4">11. 'Those who, after leaving sensual pleasures, wander about houseless, well restrained, being like a straight shuttle, on such in due time people should bestow oblations; let the Brāmaṇa who has good works in view, offer. (464)</p>

					<p class="f4">12. 'Those whose passions are gone, whose senses are well composed, who are liberated like the moon out of the grasp of Rāhu, on such in due time people should bestow oblations; let the Brāmaṇa who has good works in view, offer. (465)</p>

					<p class="f4">13. 'Those who wander about in the world without clinging (to anything), always thoughtful, having left selfishness, on such in due time people should bestow oblations; let the Brāmaṇa who has good works in view, offer. (466)</p>

					<p class="f4">14. 'He who, after leaving sensual pleasures, wanders about victorious, he who knows the end of birth and death, who is perfectly happy (parinibbuta), <a id="pg77"><span class="f2 g"><b>[77]</b></span></a> calm like a deep water, Tathāgata deserves the oblation. (467)</p>

					<p class="f4">15. 'Just with the just and far from the unjust<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn52" href="#n52">52</a>]</sup></span>, Tathāgata is possessed of infinite understanding; undefiled both in this world and in the other, Tathāgata deserves the oblation. (468)</p>

					<p class="f4">16. 'He in whom there lives no deceit, no arrogance, he who is free from cupidity, free from selfishness, free from desire, who has banished anger, who is calm, the Brāmaṇa who has removed the taint of grief, Tathāgata deserves the oblation. (469)</p>

					<p class="f4">17. 'He who has banished (every) resting-place of the mind, he for whom there is no grasping, he who covets nothing either in this world or in the other, Tathāgata deserves the oblation.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn53" href="#n53">53</a>]</sup></span> (470)</p>

					<p class="f4">18. 'He who is composed, who has crossed over the stream (of existence) and knows the Dhamma by (taking) the highest view (of it), he whose passions are destroyed, who is wearing the last body, Tathāgata deserves the oblation. (471)</p>

					<p class="f4">19. 'He whose passion for existence and whose harsh talk are destroyed, are perished, (and therefore) exist not, he the accomplished and in every respect liberated Tathāgata deserves the oblation. (472)</p>

					<p class="f4">20. 'He who has shaken off all ties, for whom there are no ties, who amongst arrogant beings is free from arrogance, having penetrated pain together with its domain and subject, Tathāgata deserves the oblation. (473)</p>

					<p class="f4">21. 'He who, without giving himself up to desire, sees seclusion (i.e. Nibbāna), who has overcome the view that is to be taught by others, to whom there <a id="pg78"><span class="f2 g"><b>[78]</b></span></a> are no objects of sense whatever, Tathāgata deserves the oblation.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn54" href="#n54">54</a>]</sup></span> (474)</p>

					<p class="f4">22. 'He to whom all Dhammas of every description, after he has penetrated them, are destroyed, are perished, (and therefore) exist not, he who is calm, liberated in the destruction of attachment (i.e. Nibbāna), Tathāgata deserves the oblation. (475)</p>

					<p class="f4">23. 'He who sees the destruction of bond and birth, who has totally evaded the path of passion, (who is) pure, faultless, spotless, undepraved, Tathāgata deserves the oblation. (476)</p>

					<p class="f4">24. 'He who does not measure himself by himself, who is composed, upright, firm, without desire, free from harshness (akhila), free from doubt, Tathāgata deserves the oblation. (477)</p>

					<p class="f4">25. 'He to whom there is no cause of folly, who has a supernatural insight in all Dhammas, who wears the last body, and who has acquired perfect enlightenment, the highest, the blessed, (for him) thus a Yakkha's purification (takes place).'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn55" href="#n55">55</a>]</sup></span> (478)</p>

					<p class="f4">26. Sundarikabhāradvāga: 'May my offering be a true offering, because I met with such a one out of the accomplished; Brahman is my witness, may Bhagavat accept me, may Bhagavat enjoy my oblation.' (479)</p>

					<p class="f4">27. Bhagavat: 'What is obtained by stanzas is not to be enjoyed by me, this is not the custom of the clearly-seeing, O Brāmaṇa; Buddhas reject what is obtained by stanzas. While the Dhamma <a id="pg79"><span class="f2 g"><b>[79]</b></span></a> exists, O Brāmaṇa, this is the practice (of the Buddhas). (480)</p>

					<p class="f4">28. 'With other food and drink must thou serve one that is perfect, a great Isi, whose passions are destroyed, and whose misbehaviour has ceased, for this is a field for one who looks for good works<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn56" href="#n56">56</a>]</sup></span>.' (481)</p>

					<p class="f4">29. Sundarikabhāradvāga: 'Good, O Bhagavat, then I should like to know, who will enjoy a gift from one like me, and whom I shall seek at the time of sacrifice (as one worthy of offerings) after having accepted thy doctrine.' (482)</p>

					<p class="f4">30. Bhagavat: 'Whosoever has no quarrels, whose mind is untroubled, and who has freed himself from lusts, whose sloth is driven away, (483)</p>

					<p class="f4">31. 'Whosoever conquers his sins, knows birth and death, the Muni who is endowed with wisdom<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn57" href="#n57">57</a>]</sup></span>, such a one who has resorted to offering, (484)</p>

					<p class="f4">32. 'Him you should worship and honour with food and drink; so the gifts will prosper.' (485)</p>

					<p class="f4">33. Sundarikabhāradvāga: 'Thou Buddha deservest the oblation, (thou art) the best field for good works, the object of offering to all the world; what is given to thee will bear great fruit.' (486)</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Brāmaṇa Sundarikabhāradvāga said this to Bhagavat: 'It is excellent, O venerable Gotama! It is excellent, O venerable Gotama! As one raises what has been overthrown, or reveals what has been hidden, or tells the way to him who has gone astray, or holds out an oil lamp in the dark that those who have eyes may see the objects, even so by the venerable Gotama in manifold ways the Dhamma has been illustrated; I take refuge in <a id="pg80"><span class="f2 g"><b>[80]</b></span></a> the venerable Gotama, in the Dhamma, and in the Assembly of Bhikkhus; I wish to receive the robe and the orders from the venerable Gotama.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The Brāmaṇa Sundarikabhāradvāga received the pabbagga from Bhagavat, and he received also the upasampada; and the venerable Bhāradvāga, having lately received the upasampada, leading a solitary, retired, strenuous, ardent, energetic life, lived after having in a short time in this existence by his own understanding ascertained and possessed himself of that highest perfection of a religious life for the sake of which men of good family rightly wander away from their houses to a houseless state. 'Birth had been destroyed, a religious life had been led, what was to be done had been done, there was nothing else (to be done) for this existence,' so he perceived, and the venerable Bhāradvāga became one of the arahats.</p>

					<p class="ctr">Buddha on being asked tells Māgha of those worthy of offerings and the blessing of offering.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it was heard by me:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time Bhagavat dwelt at Rāgagaha, in the mountain (called) the Vulture's Peak (Gigghakuta).</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the young man Māgha went to Bhagavat, and having gone to him he talked pleasantly with him, and after having had some pleasant, remarkable conversation with him he sat down apart; sitting down apart the young man Māgha spoke this to Bhagavat:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg81"><span class="f2 g"><b>[81]</b></span></a> 'O venerable Gotama, I am a liberal giver, bountiful, suitable to beg of; justly I seek for riches, and having sought for riches justly, I give out of the justly obtained and justly acquired riches to one, to two, to three, to four, to five, to six, to seven, to eight, to nine, to ten, to twenty, to thirty, to forty, to fifty, to a hundred, I give still more. (I should like to know), O venerable Gotama, whether I, while so giving, so offering, produce much good.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Certainly, O young man, dost thou in so offering produce much good; he, O young man, who is a liberal giver, bountiful, suitable to beg of, and who justly seeks for riches, and having sought for riches justly, gives out of his justly obtained and justly acquired riches to one, to two, to three, to four, to five, to six, to seven, to eight, to nine, to ten, to twenty, to thirty, to forty, to fifty, to a hundred, and gives still more, produces much good.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the young man Māgha addressed Bhagavat in stanzas:</p>

					<p class="f4">1. 'I ask the venerable Gotama, the bountiful,' — so said the young man Māgha, — 'wearing the yellow robe, wandering about houseless:' 'He who is a householder, suitable to beg of, a donor, who, desirous of good, offers having what is good in view, and giving to others in this world food and drink, — where (i.e. on whom bestowed) will the oblation of such an offerer prosper?' (487)</p>

					<p class="f4">2. 'He who is a householder, suitable to beg of, a donor, O Māgha,' — so said Bhagavat, — 'who, desirous of good, offers having what is good in view, and giving to others in this world food and drink, such a one will prosper with those worthy of offerings.' (488)</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg82"><span class="f2 g"><b>[82]</b></span></a> 3.

'He who is a householder, suitable to beg of, a donor,' — so said the young man Māgha, — 'who, desirous of good, offers having what is good in view, and giving to others in this world food and drink, — tell me (I being such a one), O Bhagavat, of the blessing of offering.' (505)</p>

					<p class="f4">20. 'Offer, O Māgha,' — so said Bhagavat, — 'and while offering make calm thy mind in all things; the object of the one that offers is the oblation, standing fast in this he leaves hatred behind. (506)</p>

					<p class="f4">21. 'Such a one whose passion is gone will repress hatred, cultivating an unbounded friendly mind; continually strenuous night and day he will spread infinite goodness through all regions.' (507)</p>

					<p class="f4">22. Māgha: 'Who prospers? who is liberated and who is bound? In which way can one by himself go to Brahmaloka? Tell this to me who does not know, O Muni, when asked. Bhagavat is indeed my witness that Brahman is seen by me to-day, for thou art to us equal to Brahman, this is the truth; how can one attain Brahmaloka, O thou glorious one?' (508)</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg85"><span class="f2 g"><b>[85]</b></span></a> 23. 'He who offers the threefold blessing of oblation, O Māgha,' — so said Bhagavat, — 'such a one will prosper with those worthy of offerings; so, having offered properly, he who is suitable to beg of attains Brahmaloka, so I say.' (509)</p>

					<p class="f4">This having been said, Māgha the young man spoke as follows to Bhagavat: 'Excellent, O venerable Gotama! Excellent, O venerable Gotama! As one raises what has been overthrown, or reveals what has been hidden, or tells the way to him who has gone astray, or holds out an oil lamp in the dark that those who have eyes may see the objects, even so by the venerable Gotama in manifold ways the Dhamma has been illustrated; I take refuge in the venerable Gotama and in the Dhamma and in the Assembly of Bhikkhus. Let the venerable Gotama accept me as an upasaka (a follower, me), who henceforth for all my life have taken refuge (in him).'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="ctr">Sabhiya, the Paribbāgaka, goes to the six famous teachers of his time to have his questions answered, but not having his doubts solved, he repairs to Gotama and asks him how one is to behave to become a Brāmaṇa, a Samaṇa, a Nahātaka, a Khettagina, a Kusala, a Paṇḍita, a Muni, a Vedagū, an Anuvidita, a Dhīra, an Āgāniya, a Sottiya, an Ariya, a Karaṇavat, a Paribbāgaka. Bhagavat answers his questions, and Sabhiya finally receives the robe and the orders from Buddha.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it was heard by me:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time Bhagavat dwelt at Rāgagaha, in Veḷuvana, in Kalandakanivāpa. And at that time questions were recited to Sabhiya, the Paribbāgaka <a id="pg86"><span class="f2 g"><b>[86]</b></span></a> (wandering mendicant), by an old benevolent deity: 'He who, O Sabhiya, be it a Samaṇa or a Brāmaṇa, explains these questions to thee when asked, near him thou shouldst live a religious life.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Sabhiya, the Paribbāgaka, having learnt the questions from that deity, went to whatever Samaṇas and Brāmaṇas there were that had an assembly (of Bhikkhus), a crowd (of followers), and were well-known teachers, famous leaders, considered excellent by the multitude, as Pūraṇa-Kassapa, Makkhali-Gosāla, Agita-Kesakambali, Pakudha-Kakkāyana, Sañgaya-Belaṭṭhiputta, and Niganṭha-Nātaputta. Those he went to, and after going to them, he asked the questions. They, being asked the questions by Sabhiya, the Paribbāgaka, did not succeed (in answering them), and not succeeding, they showed wrath and hatred and discontent, and they also in return put questions to Sabhiya, the Paribbāgaka.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then this came to the mind of Sabhiya, the Paribbāgaka: 'Whatever Samaṇas and Brāmaṇas there are that have an assembly (of Bhikkhus), a crowd (of followers), and are well-known teachers, famous leaders, considered excellent by the multitude, as Pūraṇa-Kassapa, Makkhali-Gosāla, Agita-Kesakambali, Pakudha-Kakkāyana, Sañgaya-Belaṭṭhiputta, and Niganṭha-Nātaputta, they, being asked questions by me, did not succeed (in answering them), and not succeeding they showed wrath and hatred and discontent, and they also in return put questions to me in this matter; surely I think I shall go back to what I have left, and enjoy sensual pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then this came to the mind of Sabhiya, the Paribbāgaka: 'This Samaṇa Gotama has both an <a id="pg87"><span class="f2 g"><b>[87]</b></span></a> assembly (of Bhikkhus) and a crowd (of followers), and is a well-known teacher, a famous leader, considered excellent by the multitude, surely I think I shall go to Samaṇa Gotama and ask these questions.' Then this came to the mind of Sabhiya, the Paribbāgaka: 'Whatever Samaṇas and Brāhmaṇas there are that are decayed, old, aged, advanced in years, having reached old age, experienced elders, long ordained, having assemblies (of Bhikkhus), crowds (of followers), being teachers well-known, famous leaders, considered excellent by the multitude, as Pūraṇa-Kassapa, Makkhali-Gosāla, Agita-Kesakambali, Pakudha-Kakkāyana, Sañgaya-Belaṭṭhiputta, and Niganṭha-Nātaputta, they, being asked questions by me, did not succeed (in answering them), and not succeeding they showed wrath and hatred and discontent, and they also in return put questions to me in this matter; (I should like to know) whether Samaṇa Gotama being asked these questions will be able to explain them to me, for Samaṇa Gotama is both young by birth and new in ascetic life.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then this came to the mind of Sabhiya, the Paribbāgaka: 'Samaṇa Gotama is not to be slighted because he is young; even if the Samaṇa is young, yet he is mighty and powerful; surely I think I shall go to Samaṇa Gotama and ask these questions.' Then Sabhiya, the Paribbāgaka, went on a journey to Rāgagaha, and wandering on his journey in regular order he came to Rāgagaha, Veḷuvana, Kalandakanivāpa, to Bhagavat, and having come to Bhagavat he talked pleasantly with him, and after having had some pleasant and remarkable conversation with him he sat down apart; sitting down apart <a id="pg88"><span class="f2 g"><b>[88]</b></span></a> Sabhiya, the Paribbāgaka, spoke to Bhagavat in stanzas:</p>

					<p class="f4">1. 'Anxious and doubtful I have come,' — so said Sabhiya, — 'longing to ask questions. Do thou put an end to these (doubts when) asked these questions by me, in regular order, and rightly explain them to me.' (510)</p>

					<p class="f4">2. 'Thou hast come from afar, O Sabhiya,' — so said Bhagavat, — 'longing to ask questions; I shall put an end to those (doubts when) asked those questions by thee, in regular order, and rightly I shall explain them to thee. (511)</p>

					<p class="f4">3. 'Ask me, O Sabhiya, a question; whatsoever thou wishest in thy mind that question I (will explain, and) put an end to (thy doubt).' (512)</p>

					<p class="f4">Then this came to the mind of Sabhiya, the Paribbāgaka: 'It is marvellous, it is wonderful indeed, the reception which I did not get from other Samaṇas and Brāhmaṇas has been given me by Gotama,' so saying he glad, rejoicing, delighted, and highly elated asked Bhagavat a question:</p>

					<p class="f4">4. 'What should a man (necessarily) have obtained that people may call him a Bhikkhu?' — so said Sabhiya, — 'how may they call him compassionate, and how subdued? how can he be called enlightened (buddha)? Asked (about this) do thou, Bhagavat, explain it to me.' (513)</p>

					<p class="f4">5. 'He who by the path he has himself made, O Sabhiya,' — so said Bhagavat, — 'has attained to perfect happiness, who has conquered doubt, who lives after having left behind both gain and goods, who has destroyed re-birth, he is a Bhikkhu. (514)</p>

					<p class="f4">6. 'Always resigned and attentive, he will not hurt any one in all the world, the Samaṇa who has <a id="pg89"><span class="f2 g"><b>[89]</b></span></a> crossed the stream (of existence, and is) untroubled; for whom there are no desires (ussada), he is compassionate. (515)</p>

					<p class="f4">7. 'He whose senses are trained internally and externally in all the world, he who after penetrating this and the other world longs for death, being trained, he is subdued. (516)</p>

					<p class="f4">8. 'Whosoever, after having considered all times (kappa), the revolution (saŋsāra), both the vanishing and re-appearance (of beings), is free from defilement, free from sin, is pure, and has obtained destruction of birth, him they call enlightened (buddha).' (517)</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Sabhiya, the Paribbāgaka, having approved of and rejoiced at the words of Bhagavat, glad, rejoicing, delighted, highly elated, asked Bhagavat another question:</p>

					<p class="f4">9. 'What should a man (necessarily) have obtained that people may call him a Brāmaṇa?' — so said Sabhiya, — 'and how (may they call him) a Samaṇa? and how a Nahatāka? how can he be called a Nāga? Asked (about this) do thou Bhagavat explain it to me.' (518)</p>

					<p class="f4">10. 'He who, after removing all sins, O Sabhiya,' — so said Bhagavat, — 'is immaculate, well composed, firm-minded, perfect after crossing the Saŋsāra, such an independent one is called a Brāmaṇa. (519)</p>

					<p class="f4">11. 'He who is calm, having left behind good and evil, free from defilement, having understood this and the other world, and conquered birth and death, such a one is called a Samaṇa by being so.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn59" href="#n59">59</a>]</sup></span> (520)</p>

					<p class="f4">12. 'Whosoever, after having washed away all sins internally and externally in all the world, does <a id="pg90"><span class="f2 g"><b>[90]</b></span></a> not enter time (kappa) amongst gods and men who are subject to time, him they call a Nahatāka (cleansed).<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn60" href="#n60">60</a>]</sup></span> (521)</p>

					<p class="f4">13. 'He who does not commit any crime in the world, who, after abandoning all bonds and fetters, clings to nothing, being liberated, such a one is called a Nāga (sinless) by being so.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn61" href="#n61">61</a>]</sup></span> (522)</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Sabhiya, the Paribbāgaka, having approved of and rejoiced at the words of Bhagavat, glad, rejoicing, delighted, highly elated, further asked Bhagavat a question:</p>

					<p class="f4">14. 'Whom do the Buddhas call a Khettagina?' — so said Sabhiya, — 'how (can they call any one) a Kusala? and how a Paṇḍita? how can he be called a Muni? Asked (about this) do thou Bhagavat explain it to me.' (523)</p>

					<p class="f4">15. 'He who, after examining all regions, O Sabhiya,' — so said Bhagavat, — 'the divine and the human, and Brahman's region, is delivered from the radical bond of all regions, such a one is called a Khettagina (he who has conquered the regions) by being so. (524)</p>

					<p class="f4">16. 'He who, after examining all treasures, the divine and the human, and Brahman's treasure, is delivered from the radical bond of all treasures, such a one is called a Kusala (happy) by being so. (525)</p>

					<p class="f4">17. 'He who, after examining both kinds of senses, internally and externally, is endowed with a <a id="pg91"><span class="f2 g"><b>[91]</b></span></a> clear understanding and has conquered evil and good (<i>kaṇhasukka</i>), such a one is called a Paṇḍita (wise) by being so. (526)</p>

					<p class="f4">18. 'He who, having understood the Dhamma of the just and the unjust, internally and externally, in all the world, is to be worshipped by gods and men, he, after breaking through the net of ties, is called a Muni (sage).' (527)</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Sabhiya, the Paribbāgaka, having approved of and rejoiced at the words of Bhagavat, glad, rejoicing, delighted, highly elated, further asked Bhagavat a question:</p>

					<p class="f4">19. 'What should one (necessarily) have obtained that people may call him Vedagū?' — so said Sabhiya, — 'and how (may they call him) Anuvidita? and how Viriyavat? How does one become Āgāniya? Asked (about this) do thou, O Bhagavat, explain it to me.' (528)</p>

					<p class="f4">20. 'He who, having conquered all sensations, O Sabhiya,' — so said Bhagavat, — 'which are (known) to Samaṇas and to Brāmaṇas, is free from passion for all sensations, he is Vedagū (having passed sensation) after conquering all sensation. (529)</p>

					<p class="f4">21. 'He who, having seen the delusion of name and form,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn62" href="#n62">62</a>]</sup></span> internally and externally, the root of sickness, and is delivered from the radical bond of all sickness, such a one is called Anuvidita (well-informed) by being so. (530)</p>

					<p class="f4">22. 'He who is disgusted in this world with all sins, is strong after conquering the pain of hell, is strong and powerful, such a one is called Dhīra ( = viriyavat, firm) by being so. (531)</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg92"><span class="f2 g"><b>[92]</b></span></a> 23. 'He whose bonds are cut off internally and externally, the root of ties<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn63" href="#n63">63</a>]</sup></span>, who is delivered from the radical bond of all ties, such a one is called Āgāniya (high-bred) by being so.' (532)</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Sabhiya, the Paribbāgaka, having approved of and rejoiced at the words of Bhagavat, glad, rejoicing, delighted, highly elated, further asked Bhagavat a question:</p>

					<p class="f4">24. 'What should a man (necessarily) have obtained that people may call him a Sottiya?' — so said Sabhiya, — 'how (may they call him) an Ariya? and how a Karaṇavat? how may he become a Paribbāgaka? Asked (about this) do thou, O Bhagavat, explain it to me.' (533)</p>

					<p class="f4">25. 'Whosoever, after having heard and understood every Dhamma in the world, O Sabhiya,' — so said Bhagavat, — 'whatsoever is wrong and whatsoever is blameless, is victorious, free from doubt, liberated, free from pain in every respect, him they call a Sottiya (learned in the revelation). (534)</p>

					<p class="f4">26. 'Whosoever, after having cut off passions and desires, is wise and does not (again) enter the womb, having driven away the threefold sign, the mud (of lust), and who does not (again) enter time (kappa), him they call an Ariya (noble). (535)</p>

					<p class="f4">27. 'He who in this world, after having attained the (highest) gain in the Karaṇas, is skilful, has always understood the Dhamma, clings to nothing, is liberated, and for whom there are no passions, he is a Karaṇavat (endowed with the obsrvances). (536)</p>

					<p class="f4">28. 'Whosoever abstains from the action that has a painful result, above and below and across and in <a id="pg93"><span class="f2 g"><b>[93]</b></span></a> the middle, who wanders with understanding, who has put an end to deceit, arrogance, cupidity and anger, name and form, him they call a Paribbāgaka (a wandering mendicant) who has attained the (highest) gain.' (537)</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Sabhiya, the Paribbāgaka, having approved of and rejoiced at the words of Bhagavat, glad, rejoicing, delighted, highly elated, having risen from his seat, and having put his upper robe upon one shoulder, bending his joined hands towards Bhagavat, praised Bhagavat face to face in appropriate stanzas:</p>

					<p class="f4">29. 'Having conquered the three and sixty (philosophical) views referring to the disputations of the Samaṇas, thou hast crossed over the darkness of the stream.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn64" href="#n64">64</a>]</sup></span> (?) (538)</p>

					<p class="f4">30. 'Thou hast passed to the end of and beyond pain, thou art a saint, perfectly enlightened, I consider thee one that has destroyed his passions, thou art glorious, thoughtful, of great understanding, O thou who puts an end to pain, thou hast carried me across. (539)</p>

					<p class="f4">31. 'Because thou sawest my longing, and carriedst me across my doubt, adoration be to thee, O Muni, who hast attained the (highest) gain in the ways of wisdom; O thou who art a true kinsman of the Ādikkas, thou art compassionate. (540)</p>

					<p class="f4">32. 'The doubt I had before thou hast cleared away for me, O thou clearly-seeing; surely thou art a Muni, perfectly enlightened, there is no obstacle for thee. (541)</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg94"><span class="f2 g"><b>[94]</b></span></a> 33. 'And all thy troubles are scattered and cut off, thou art calm, subdued, firm, truthful. (542)</p>

					<p class="f4">34. 'All gods and both Nārada and Pabbata rejoice at thee, the chief of the sinless (naganaga), the great hero, when thou art speaking. (543)</p>

					<p class="f4">35. 'Adoration be to thee, O noble man, adoration be to thee, O thou best of men; in the world of men and gods there is no man equal to thee. (544)</p>

					<p class="f4">36. 'Thou art Buddha, thou art the Master, thou art the Muni that conquers Māra; after having cut off desire thou hast crossed over and hast carried across this generation. (545)</p>

					<p class="f4">37. 'The elements of existence (upadhi) are overcome by thee, the passions are destroyed by thee, thou art a lion, free from desire, thou hast left behind fear and terror. (546)</p>

					<p class="f4">38. 'As a beautiful lotus does not adhere to the water, so thou dost not cling to good and evil, to either; stretch forth thy feet, O hero, Sabbiya worships the Master's (feet).' (547)</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Sabhiya, the Paribbāgaka, stooping with his head to Bhagavat's feet, said this to Bhagavat:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is excellent, O venerable! It is excellent, O venerable! As one raises what has been overthrown, or reveals what has been hidden, or tells the way to him who has gone astray, or holds out an oil lamp in the dark that those who have eyes may see the objects, even so by the venerable Gotama in manifold ways the Dhamma has been illustrated; I take refuge in the venerable Gotama, in the Dhamma, and in the Assembly of Bhikkhus; I wish to receive the robe and the orders from the venerable Bhagavat.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'He who, O Sabhiya, formerly belonging <a id="pg95"><span class="f2 g"><b>[95]</b></span></a> another creed <i>(aññatitthiyapubba)</i>, wishes to be adopted into this religion <i>(dhammavinaya)</i>, and wishes to receive the robe and the orders, he serves for four months; after the lapse of four months Bhikkhus who have appeased their thoughts will give him the robe and the orders to become a Bhikkhu, (for) I also in this matter acknowledge difference of persons.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'If, O venerable, those that formerly belonged to another creed and wish to be adopted into this religion and to receive the robe and the orders, serve for four months, and after the lapse of four months Bhikkhus who have appeased their thoughts give them the robe and the orders that they may become Bhikkhus, I will (also) serve for four months, and after the lapse of four months Bhikkhus who have appeased their thoughts shall give (me) the robe and the orders that I may become a Bhikkhu.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Sabhiya, the Paribbāgaka, received the robe and the orders from Bhagavat, and the venerable Sabhiya, having lately received the upasampada, leading a solitary, retired, strenuous, ardent, energetic life, lived after having in a short time in this existence by his own understanding ascertained and possessed himself of that highest perfection of a religious life for the sake of which men of good family rightly wander away from their houses to a houseless state. 'Birth had been destroyed, a religious life had been led, what was to be done had been done, there was nothing else (to be done) for this existence,' so he perceived, and the venerable Sabhiya became one of the saints.</p>

					<p class="ctr">Keṇiya, the Gaṭila, invites Buddha with his assembly to take his meals with him on the morrow. Sela, the Brāmaṇa, arrived at that place with his three hundred young men; seeing the preparations he asks what is going on, and is answered that Buddha is expected the next day. On hearing the word 'Buddha,' Sela asks where Buddha lives, goes to him, converses with him, and is converted; so are his followers.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it was heard by me:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time Bhagavat wandering about in Aṇguttarāpa, with a large assembly of Bhikkhus, with 1250 Bhikkhus, went to Āpaṇa, a town in Aṇguttarāpa.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Keṇiya, the ascetic, with matted hair (Gaṭila) heard the following: 'The Samaṇa, the venerable Gotama, the Sakya son, gone out from the family of the Sakyas, wandering about in Aṇguttarāpa with a large assembly of Bhikkhus, with 1250 Bhikkhus, has reached Āpaṇa, and the following good praising words met the venerable Gotama: "And so he is Bhagavat, the venerable, the perfectly enlightened, endowed with science and works (viggākaraṇa), the happy, knowing the world, the incomparable, the charioteer of men that are to be subdued, the master, the enlightened of gods and men, the glorious; he teaches this world and the world of gods, of Māras, of Brahmans, and beings comprising Samaṇas and Brāmaṇas, gods and men, having himself known and seen them face to face; he teaches the Dhamma (which is) good in the beginning, in the middle, and in the end, is full of meaning and rich in words, quite complete; he teaches a religious life, and good is the sight of such saints."'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Keṇiya, the Gaṭila, went (to the place) where <a id="pg97"><span class="f2 g"><b>[97]</b></span></a> Bhagavat was, and having gone there he talked pleasantly with him, and after having had some pleasant and remarkable conversation (with him) he sat down apart; and while Keṇiya, the Gaṭila, was sitting down apart, Bhagavat, by religious talk, taught, advised, roused, and delighted him. Then Keṇiya, the Gaṭila, having been taught, advised, roused, and delighted by Bhagavat through religious talk, said this to Bhagavat:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let the venerable Gotama accept my food tomorrow, together with the assembly of Bhikkhus.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This having been said, Bhagavat answered Keṇiya, the Gaṭila: 'Large, O Keṇiya, is the assembly of Bhikkhus, one thousand two hundred and fifty Bhikkhus, and thou art intimate with the Brāmaṇas.'</p>

					<p class="f4">A second time Keṇiya, the Gaṭila, said this to Bhagavat: 'Although, O venerable Gotama, the assembly of Bhikkhus is large, one thousand two hundred and fifty Bhikkhus, and I am intimate with the Brāmaṇas, let the venerable Gotama accept my food to-morrow, together with the assembly of Bhikkhus.'</p>

					<p class="f4">A second time Bhagavat said this to Keṇiya, the Gaṭila: 'Large, O Keṇiya, is the assembly of Bhikkhus, one thousand two hundred and fifty Bhikkhus, and thou art intimate with the Brāmaṇas.'</p>

					<p class="f4">A third time Keṇiya, the Gaṭila, said this to Bhagavat: 'Although, O venerable Gotama, the assembly of Bhikkhus is large, one thousand two hundred and fifty Bhikkhus, and I am intimate with the Brāhmaṇas, yet let the venerable Gotama accept my food to-morrow, together with the assembly of Bhikkhus.' Bhagavat assented by being silent.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg98"><span class="f2 g"><b>[98]</b></span></a> Then Keṇiya, the Gaṭila, having learnt the assent of Bhagavat, after rising from his seat went to his hermitage, and having gone there he addressed his friends and servants, his relatives and kinsmen (as follows): 'Let my venerable friends and servants, relatives and kinsmen hear me; — the Samaṇa Gotama has been invited by me to (take his) food (with me) to-morrow, together with the assembly of Bhikkhus; wherefore you must render me bodily service.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Surely, O venerable one,' so saying the friends and servants, relatives and kinsmen of Keṇiya, the Gaṭila, complying with his request, some of them dug fireplaces, some chopped firewood, some washed the vessels, some placed waterpots, some prepared seats. Keṇiya, the Gaṭila, on the other hand, himself provided a circular pavilion.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time the Brāmaṇa Sela lived at Āpaṇa, perfect in the three Vedas, vocabulary, Keṭubha, etymology, Itihāsa as the fifth (Veda), versed in metre, a grammarian, one not deficient in popular controversy and the signs of a great man, he taught three hundred young men the hymns.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn65" href="#n65">65</a>]</sup></span> At that time Keṇiya, the Gaṭila, was intimate with the Brāhmaṇa Sela.

And the Brāmaṇa Sela saw the Gaṭilas in Keṇiya's hermitage, some of them digging fireplaces, some chopping firewood, some washing the vessels, some placing waterpots, some <a id="pg99"><span class="f2 g"><b>[99]</b></span></a> preparing seats, and Keṇiya, the Gaṭila, on the other hand, himself providing a circular pavilion; seeing Keṇiya, the Gaṭila, he said this: 'Is the venerable Keṇiya to celebrate the marriage of a son or the marriage of a daughter, or is there a great sacrifice at hand, or has Bimbisāra, the king of Magadha, who has a large body of troops, been invited for to-morrow, together with his army?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am not to celebrate the marriage of a son or the marriage of a daughter, nor has Bimbisāra, the king of Magadha, who has a large body of troops, been invited for to-morrow, together with his army, yet a great sacrifice of mine is at hand. The Samaṇa Gotama, the Sakya son, gone out from the Sakya family, wandering about in Aṇguttarāpa with a large assembly of Bhikkhus, one thousand two hundred and fifty Bhikkhus, has reached Āpaṇa, and the following good praising words met the venerable Gotama: "And so he is Bhagavat, the venerable, the perfectly enlightened, endowed with science and works (viggākaraṇa), the happy, knowing the world, the incomparable, the charioteer of men that are to be subdued, the master, the enlightened of gods and men, the glorious, he has been invited by me for to-morrow, together with the assembly of Bhikkhus."'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then this occurred to the Brāhmaṇa Sela: 'This sound "Buddha" is (indeed) rare, but in our hymns <a id="pg100"><span class="f2 g"><b>[100]</b></span></a> are to be found the thirty-two signs of a great man, and for a great man endowed with these there are two conditions, and no more: if he lives in a house he is a king, a universal (king), a just religious king, a lord of the four-cornered (earth), a conqueror, one who has obtained the security of his people (and) is possessed of the seven gems. These are his seven gems, namely, the wheel gem, the elephant gem, the horse gem, the pearl gem, the woman gem, the householder gem, and the chief gem as the seventh. He has more than a thousand sons, heroes, possessing great bodily strength and crushing foreign armies; he having conquered this ocean-girt earth without a rod and without a weapon, but by justice, lives (in a house). But if, on the other hand, he goes out from (his) house to the houseless state, he becomes a saint, a perfectly enlightened, one who has removed the veil in the world. And where, O venerable Keṇiya, dwells now that venerable Gotama, the saint and the perfectly enlightened?'</p>

					<p class="f4">This having been said, Keṇiya, the Gaṭila, stretching out his right arm, spoke as follows to the Brāmaṇa Sela: 'There, where yon blue forest line is, O venerable Sela.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Brāmaṇa Sela together with (his) three hundred young men went to the place where Bhagavat was. Then the Brāmaṇa Sela addressed those young men: 'Come ye, venerable ones, with but little noise, walking step by step, for Bhagavats are difficult of access, walking alone like lions, and when I speak to the venerable Samaṇa Gotama, do ye not utter interrupting words, but wait ye venerable ones, for the end of my speech.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Brāmaṇa Sela went to the place where <a id="pg101"><span class="f2 g"><b>[101]</b></span></a> Bhagavat was, and having gone there he talked pleasantly with Bhagavat, and after having had some pleasant and remarkable conversation with him he sat down apart, and while sitting down apart Sela, the Brāhmaṇa, looked for the thirty-two signs of a great man on the body of Bhagavat. And the Brāmaṇa Sela saw the thirty-two signs of a great man on the body of Bhagavat with the exception of two; in respect to two of the signs of a great man he had doubts, he hesitated, he was not satisfied, he was not assured as to the member being enclosed in a membrane and as to his having a large tongue.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then this occurred to Bhagavat: 'This Brāmaṇa Sela sees in me the thirty-two signs of a great man with the exception of two, in respect to two of the signs of a great man he has doubts, he hesitates, he is not satisfied, he is not assured as to the member being enclosed in a membrane, and as to my having a large tongue.' Then Bhagavat created such a miraculous creature that the Brāmaṇa Sela might see Bhagavat's member enclosed in a membrane. Then Bhagavat having put out his tongue touched and stroked both his ears, touched and stroked both nostrils, and the whole circumference of his forehead he covered with his tongue.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then this occurred to the Brāhmaṇa Sela: 'The Samaṇa Gotama is endowed with the thirty-two signs of a great man, with them all, not with (only) some of them, and yet I do not know whether he is a Buddha or not; I have heard old and aged Brāhmaṇas, teachers and their previous teachers, say that those who are saints and perfectly enlightened manifest themselves when their praise is uttered. I think I shall praise the Samaṇa Gotama face to <a id="pg102"><span class="f2 g"><b>[102]</b></span></a> face in suitable stanzas.' Then the Brāmaṇa Sela praised Bhagavat face to face in suitable stanzas:</p>

					<p class="f4">1. 'Thou hast a perfect body, thou art resplendent, well-born, of beautiful aspect, thou hast a golden colour, O Bhagavat, thou hast very white teeth, thou art strong. (548)</p>

					<p class="f4">2. 'All the signs that are for a well-born man, they are on thy body, the signs of a great man. (549)</p>

					<p class="f4">3. 'Thou hast a bright eye, a handsome countenance, thou art great, straight, majestic, thou shinest like a sun in the midst of the assembly of the Samaṇas. (550)</p>

					<p class="f4">4. 'Thou art a Bhikkhu of a lovely appearance, thou hast a skin like gold; what is the use of being a Samaṇa to thee who art possessed of the highest beauty? (551)</p>

					<p class="f4">5. 'Thou deservest to be a king, a king of universal kings, a ruler of the four-cornered (earth), a conqueror, a lord of the jambu grove (i.e. India). (552)</p>

					<p class="f4">6. 'Khattiyas and wealthy kings are devoted to thee; rule, O Gotama, as a king of kings, a leader of men.' (553)</p>

					<p class="f4">7. 'I am a king, O Sela,' — so said Bhagavat, — 'an incomparable, religious king (dhammarāgan), with justice (<i>dhammena</i>) I turn the wheel, a wheel that is irresistible.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn66" href="#n66">66</a>]</sup></span> (554)</p>

					<p class="f4">8. 'Thou acknowledgest thyself (to be) perfectly enlightened (<i>sambuddha</i>),' — so said Sela, the Brāhmaṇa, — 'an incomparable, religious king; "with justice I turn the wheel," so thou sayest, O Gotama. (555)</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg103"><span class="f2 g"><b>[103]</b></span></a> 9. 'Who is thy general, (who is thy) disciple, (who is) the successor of the master, who is to turn after thee the wheel of religion turned (by thee)? ' (556)</p>

					<p class="f4">10. 'The wheel turned by me, O Sela,' — so said Bhagavat, — 'the incomparable wheel of religion, Sāriputta is to turn after (me), he taking after Tathāgata. (557)</p>

					<p class="f4">11. 'What is to be known is known (by me), what is to be cultivated is cultivated (by me), what is to be left is left by me, therefore I am a Buddha, O Brāmaṇa. (558)</p>

					<p class="f4">12. 'Subdue thy doubt about me, have faith (in me), O Brāmaṇa, difficult (to obtain) is the sight of Buddhas repeatedly. (559)</p>

					<p class="f4">13. 'Of those whose manifestation is difficult for you (to obtain) in the world repeatedly, I am, O Brāmaṇa, a perfectly enlightened, an incomparable physician, (560)</p>

					<p class="f4">14. 'Most eminent, matchless, a crusher of Māra's army; having subjected all enemies I rejoice secure on every side.' (561)</p>

					<p class="f4">15. Sela: 'O venerable ones, pay attention to this: as the clearly-seeing (Buddha) says, (so it is): he is a physician, a great hero, and roars like a lion in the forest. (562)</p>

					<p class="f4">16. 'Who, having seen him, the most eminent, the matchless, the crusher of Māra's army, is not appeased, even if he be, of black origin (kaṇhābhigātika). (563)</p>

					<p class="f4">17. 'He who likes me, let him follow after (me), he who does not like me, let him go away; I shall at once take the orders in the presence of him of excellent understanding (i.e. Buddha).' (564)</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg104"><span class="f2 g"><b>[104]</b></span></a> 18. The followers of Sela: 'If this doctrine of the perfectly enlightened pleases thee, we also shall take the orders in the presence of him of excellent understanding.' (565)</p>

					<p class="f4">19. These three hundred Brāmaṇas asked with clasped hands (to be admitted into the order): 'We want to cultivate a religious life, O Bhagavat, in thy presence.' (566)</p>

					<p class="f4">20. 'A religious life is well taught (by me), O Sela,' — so said Bhagavat, — 'an instantaneous, an immediate (life), in which it is not in vain to become an ascetic to one who learns in earnest.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn67" href="#n67">67</a>]</sup></span> (567)</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Brāmaṇa Sela together with his assembly took the robe and the orders in the presence of Bhagavat.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Keṇiya, the Gaṭila, by the expiration of that night, having provided in his hermitage nice hard food and soft food, let Bhagavat know the time (of the meal): 'It is time, O venerable Gotama, the meal is prepared.' Then Bhagavat in the morning, having put on his raiment and taken his bowl and robes, went to the Gaṭila Keṇiya's hermitage, and having gone there he sat down on the prepared seat, together with the assembly of Bhikkhus. Then Keṇiya, the Gaṭila, satisfied and served with his own hands the assembly of Bhikkhus, with Buddha at their head, with nice hard food and soft food. Then Keṇiya, the Gaṭila, having gone up to Bhagavat who had finished eating and had taken his hand out of the bowl, took a low seat and sat down apart, and <a id="pg105"><span class="f2 g"><b>[105]</b></span></a> while Keṇiya, the Gaṭila, was sitting down apart, Bhagavat delighted him with these stanzas:</p>

					<p class="f4">21. 'The principal thing in sacrifice is the sacred fire, the principal thing amongst the hymns is the Sāvittī,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn68" href="#n68">68</a>]</sup></span> the king is the principal amongst men, and the sea the principal amongst waters (nadinam<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn69" href="#n69">69</a>]</sup></span>). (568)</p>

					<p class="f4">22. 'Amongst the stars the moon is the principal thing, the sun is the principal thing amongst the burning<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn70" href="#n70">70</a>]</sup></span> (objects), amongst those that wish for good works and make offerings the assembly (saɱgha) indeed is the principal.' (569)</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Bhagavat, having delighted Keṇiya, the Gaṭila, with these stanzas, rose from (his) seat and went away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Sela together with his assembly leading a solitary, retired, strenuous, ardent, energetic life, lived after having in a short time in this existence by his own understanding ascertained and possessed himself of that highest perfection of a religious life for the sake of which men of good family rightly wander away from their houses to a houseless state; 'birth (had been) destroyed, a religious life (had been) led, what was to be done (had been) done, there was nothing else (to be done) for this existence,' so he perceived, and the venerable Sela together with his assembly became one of the saints.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Sela together with his assembly went to Bhagavat, and having gone (to him) he put his upper robe on one shoulder, and bending his joined hands towards Bhagavat he addressed him in stanzas:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg106"><span class="f2 g"><b>[106]</b></span></a> 23. 'Because we took refuge in thee on the eighth day previous to this, O thou clearly-seeing, in seven nights, O Bhagavat, we have been trained in thy doctrine. (570)</p>

					<p class="f4">24. 'Thou art Buddha, thou art the Master, thou art the Muni that conquered Māra, thou hast, after cutting off the affections, crossed over (the stream of existence) and taken over these beings. (571)</p>

					<p class="f4">25. 'The elements of existence (upadhi) have been overcome by thee, the passions have been destroyed by thee, thou art a lion not seizing on anything, thou hast left behind fear and danger. (572)</p>

					<p class="f4">26. 'These three hundred Bhikkhus stand here with clasped hands; stretch out thy feet, O hero, let the Nāgas worship the Master's feet.' (573)</p>

					<p class="ctr">Life is short, all mortals are subject to death, but knowing the terms of the world the wise do not grieve, and those who have left sorrow will be blessed. — Text in the <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/jat/jat.4/jat.4.461.rous.pts.htm"><i>Dasaratha-Gātaka,</i> p. 34.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">1. Without a cause and unknown is the life of mortals in this world, troubled and brief, and combined with pain. (574)</p>

					<p class="f4">2. For there is not any means by which those that have been born can avoid dying; after reaching old age there is death, of such a nature are living beings. (575)</p>

					<p class="f4">3. As ripe fruits are early in danger of falling, so mortals when born are always in danger of death. (576)</p>

					<p class="f4">4. As all earthen vessels made by the potter end in being broken, so is the life of mortals. (577)</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg107"><span class="f2 g"><b>[107]</b></span></a> 5. Both young and grown-up men, both those who are fools and those who are wise men, all fall into the power of death, all are subject to death. (578)</p>

					<p class="f4">6. Of those who, overcome by death, go to the other world, a father does not save his son, nor relatives their relations. (579)</p>

					<p class="f4">7. Mark! while relatives are looking on and lamenting greatly, one by one of the mortals is carried off, like an ox that is going to be killed. (580)</p>

					<p class="f4">8. So the world is afflicted with death and decay, therefore the wise do not grieve, knowing the terms of the world. (581)</p>

					<p class="f4">9. For him, whose way thou dost not know, either when he is coming or when he is going, not seeing both ends, thou grievest in vain. (582)</p>

					<p class="f4">10. If he who grieves gains anything, (although he is only) a fool hurting himself, let the wise man do the same. (583)</p>

					<p class="f4">11. Not from weeping nor from grieving will any one obtain peace of mind; (on the contrary), the greater his pain will be, and his body will suffer. (584)</p>

					<p class="f4">12. He will be lean and pale, hurting himself by himself, (and yet) the dead are not saved, lamentation (therefore) is of no avail. (585)</p>

					<p class="f4">13. He who does not leave grief behind, goes (only) deeper into pain; bewailing the dead he falls into the power of grief. (586)</p>

					<p class="f4">14. Look at others passing away, men that go (to what they deserve) according to their deeds, beings trembling already here, after falling into the power of death. (587)</p>

					<p class="f4">15. In whatever manner people think (it will come to pass), different from that it becomes, so great is <a id="pg108"><span class="f2 g"><b>[108]</b></span></a> the disappointment<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn71" href="#n71">71</a>]</sup></span> (in this world); see, (such are) the terms of the world.

					<p class="f4">16. Even if a man lives a hundred years or even more, he is at last separated from the company of his relatives, and leaves life in this world. (589)</p>

					<p class="f4">17. Therefore let one, hearing (the words of) the saint, subdue his lamentation; seeing the one that has passed away and is dead, (let him say): 'He will not be found by me (any more).' (590)</p>

					<p class="f4">18. As a house on fire is extinguished by water, so also the wise, sensible, learned, clever man rapidly drives away sorrow that has arisen, as the wind a tuft of cotton. (591)</p>

					<p class="f4">19. He who seeks his own happiness should draw out his arrow (which is) his lamentation, and complaint, and grief. (592)</p>

					<p class="f4">20. He who has drawn out the arrow and is not dependent (on anything) will obtain peace of mind; he who has overcome all sorrow will become free from sorrow, and blessed (nibbuta). (593)</p>

					<p class="ctr">A dispute arose between two young men, Bhāradvāga and Vāseṭṭha, the former contending man to be a Brāmaṇa by birth, the latter by deeds. They agreed to go and ask Samaṇa Gotama, and he answered that man is a Brāmaṇa by his work only. The two young men are converted. — Text (from <i>Magghimanikāya</i>) and translation in Alwis's <i>Buddhist Nirvāna,</i> p. 103.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it was heard by me:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time Bhagavat dwelt at Ikkhānaɱkala, in the Ikkhānaɱkala forest. At that time many distinguished, <a id="pg109"><span class="f2 g"><b>[109]</b></span></a> wealthy Brāmaṇas lived at Ikkhānaɱkala, as the Brāmaṇa Kaɱkin, the Brāmaṇa Tārukkha, the Brāmaṇa Pokkharasāti, the Brāhmaṇa Gānussoṇi, the Brāmaṇa Todeyya, and other distinguished, wealthy Brāmaṇas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then this dialogue arose between the young men Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāga while walking about:</p>

					<p class="f4">'How does one become a Brāmaṇa?'</p>

					<p class="f4">The young man Bhāradvāga said: 'When one is noble by birth on both sides, on the mother's and on the father's side, of pure conception up to the seventh generation of ancestors, not discarded and not reproached in point of birth, in this way one is a Brāmaṇa.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The young man Vāseṭṭha said: 'When one is virtuous and endowed with (holy) works, in this way he is a Brāmaṇa.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Neither could the young man Bhāradvāga convince the young man Vāseṭṭha, nor could the young man Vāseṭṭha convince the young man Bhāradvāga. Then the young man Vāseṭṭha addressed the young man Bhāradvāga: 'O Bhāradvāga, this Samaṇa Gotama, the Sakya son, gone out from the Sakya family, dwells at Ikkhānaɱkala, in the forest of Ikkhānaɱkala, and the following good praising words met the venerable Gotama: "And so he is Bhagavat, the venerable, the enlightened, the glorious, let us go, O venerable Bhāradvāga, let us go (to the place) where the Samaṇa Gotama is, and having gone there let us ask the Samaṇa Gotama about this matter, and as the Samaṇa Gotama replies so will we understand it."'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Very well, O venerable one;' so the young man Bhāradvāga answered the young man Vāseṭṭha.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg110"><span class="f2 g"><b>[110]</b></span></a> Then the young men Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāga went (to the place) where Bhagavat was, and having gone, they talked pleasantly with Bhagavat, and after having had some pleasant and remarkable conversation (with him) they sat down apart. Sitting down apart the young man Vāseṭṭha addressed Bhagavat in stanzas:</p>

					<p class="f4">1. 'We are accepted and acknowledged masters of the three Vedas,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn72" href="#n72">72</a>]</sup></span> I am (a pupil) of Pokkharasāti, and this young man is (the pupil) of Tārukkha. (594)</p>

					<p class="f4">2. 'We are accomplished in all the knowledge propounded by those who are acquainted with the three Vedas, we are padakas (versed in the metre), veyyākaraṇas (grammarians?), and equal to our teachers in recitation <i>(gappa)</i>.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn73" href="#n73">73</a>]</sup></span> (595)</p>

					<p class="f4">3. 'We have a controversy regarding (the distinctions of) birth, O Gotama! Bhāradvāga says, one is a Brāmaṇa by birth, and I say, by deeds; know this, O thou clearly-seeing! (596)</p>

					<p class="f4">4. 'We are both unable to convince each other, (therefore) we have come to ask thee (who art) celebrated as perfectly enlightened. (597)</p>

					<p class="f4">5. 'As people adoring the full moon worship (her) with uplifted clasped hands, so (they worship) Gotama in the world. (598)</p>

					<p class="f4">7. 'I will explain to you, O Vāseṭṭha,' — so said Bhagavat, — 'in due order the exact distinction of living beings according to species, for their species are manifold. (600)</p>

					<p class="f4">14. 'As in these species the marks that constitute species are abundant, so in men the marks that constitute species are not abundant. (607)</p>

					<p class="f4">15. 'Not as regards their hair, head, ears, eyes, mouth, nose, lips, or brows, (608)</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="ctr">Kokāliya abuses Sāriputta and Moggallāna to Buddha; therefore as soon as he has left Buddha, he is struck with boils, dies and goes to the Paduma hell, whereupon Buddha describes to the Bhikkhus the punishment of backbiters in hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it was heard by me:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time Bhagavat dwelt at Sāvatthī, in Getavana, in the park of Anāthapiṇḍika. Then the Bhikkhu Kokāliya approached Bhagavat, and after having approached and saluted Bhagavat he sat down apart; sitting down apart the Bhikkhu Kokāliya said this to Bhagavat: "O thou venerable one, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have evil desires, they have fallen into the power of evil desires.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said, Bhagavat spoke to the Bhikkhu Kokāliya as follows: '(Do) not (say) so, Kokāliya; (do) not (say) so, Kokāliya; appease, O Kokāliya, (thy) mind in regard to Sāriputta and Moggallāna: Sāriputta and Moggallāna are amiable.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn80" href="#n80">80</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">A second time the Bhikkhu Kokāliya said this to Bhagavat: 'Although thou, O venerable Bhagavat, (appearest) to me (to be) faithful and trustworthy, yet Sāriputta and Moggallāna have evil desires, they have fallen into the power of evil desires.'</p>

					<p class="f4">A second time Bhagavat said this to the Bhikkhu Kokāliya: '(Do) not (say) so, Kokāliya; (do) not (say) so, Kokāliya; appease, O Kokāliya, (thy) mind in regard to Sāriputta and Moggallāna: Sāriputta and Moggallāna are amiable.'</p>

					<p class="f4">A third time the Bhikkhu Kokāliya said this to Bhagavat: 'Although thou, O venerable Bhagavat, (appearest) to me (to be) faithful and trustworthy, <a id="pg119"><span class="f2 g"><b>[119]</b></span></a> yet Sāriputta and Moggallāna have evil desires, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have fallen into the power of evil desires.'</p>

					<p class="f4">A third time Bhagavat said this to the Bhikkhu Kokāliya: '(Do) not (say) so, Kokāliya; (do) not (say) so, Kokāliya; appease, O Kokāliya, (thy) mind in regard to Sāriputta and Moggallāna: Sāriputta and Moggallāna are amiable.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Bhikkhu Kokāliya, after having risen from his seat and saluted Bhagavat and walked round him towards the right, went away; and when he had been gone a short time, all his body was struck with boils as large as mustard seeds; after being only as large as mustard seeds, they became as large as kidney beans; after being only as large as kidney beans, they became as large as chick peas; after being only as large as chick peas, they became as large as a Kolatthi egg (?); after being only as large as a Kolatthi egg, they became as large as the jujube fruit; after being only as large as the jujube fruit, they became as large as the fruit of the emblic myrobalan; after being only as large as the fruit of the emblic myrobalan, they became as large as the unripe beluva fruit; after being only as large as the unripe beluva fruit, they became as large as a billi fruit (?); after being as large as a billi fruit, they broke, and matter and blood flowed out. Then the Bhikkhu Kokāliya died of that disease, and when he had died the Bhikkhu Kokāliya went to the Paduma hell, having shown a hostile mind against Sāriputta and Moggallāna. Then when the night had passed Brahman Sahampati of a beautiful appearance, having lit up all Getavana, approached Bhagavat, and having approached and saluted Bhagavat, <a id="pg120"><span class="f2 g"><b>[120]</b></span></a> he stood apart, and standing apart Brahman Sahampati said this to Bhagavat: 'O thou venerable one, Kokāliya, the Bhikkhu, is dead and after death, O thou venerable one, the Bhikkhu Kokāliya is gone to the Paduma hell, having shown a hostile mind against Sāriputta and Moggallāna.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This said Brahman Sahampati, and after saying this and saluting Bhagavat, and walking round him towards the right, he disappeared there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Bhagavat, after the expiration of that night, addressed the Bhikkhus thus: 'Last night, O Bhikkhus, when the night had (nearly) passed, Brahman Sahampati of a beautiful appearance, having lit up all Getavana, approached Bhagavat, and having approached and saluted Bhagavat, he stood apart, and standing apart Brahman Sahampati said this to Bhagavat: "O thou venerable one, Kokāliya, the Bhikkhu, is dead; and after death, O thou venerable one, the Bhikkhu Kokāliya is gone to the Paduma hell, having shown a hostile mind against Sāriputta and Moggallāna." This said Brahman Sahampati, O Bhikkhus, and having said this and saluted me, and walked round me towards the right, he disappeared there.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said, a Bhikkhu asked Bhagavat: 'How long is the rate of life, O venerable one, in the Paduma hell?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Long, O Bhikkhu, is the rate of life in the Paduma hell, it is not easy to calculate either (by saying) so many years or so many hundreds of years or so many thousands of years or so many hundred thousands of years.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'But it is possible, I suppose, to make a comparison, O thou venerable one?'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg121"><span class="f2 g"><b>[121]</b></span></a> 'It is possible, O Bhikkhu;' so saying, Bhagavat spoke (as follows): 'Even as, O Bhikkhu, (if there were) a Kosala load of sesamum seed containing twenty kharis, and a man after the lapse of every hundred years were to take from it one sesamum seed at a time, then that Kosala load of sesamum seed, containing twenty kharis, would, O Bhikkhu, sooner by this means dwindle away and be used up than one Abbuda hell; and even as are twenty Abbuda hells, O Bhikkhu, so is one Nirabbuda hell; and even as are twenty Nirabbuda hells, O Bhikkhu, so is one Ababa hell; and even as are twenty Ababa hells, O Bhikkhu, so is one Ahaha hell; and even as are twenty Ahaha hells, O Bhikkhu, so is one Aṭaṭa hell; and even as are twenty Aṭaṭa hells, O Bhikkhu, so is one Kumuda hell; and even as are twenty Kumuda hells, O Bhikkhu, so is one Sogandhika hell; and even as are twenty Sogandhika hells, O Bhikkhu, so is one Uppalaka hell; and even as are twenty Uppalaka hells, O Bhikkhu, so is one Puṇḍarīka hell; and even as are twenty Puṇḍarīka hells, O Bhikkhu, so is one Paduma hell; and to the Paduma hell, O Bhikkhu, the Bhikkhu Kokāliya is gone, having shown a hostile mind against Sāriputta and Moggallāna.' This said Bhagavat, and having said this Sugata, the Master, furthermore spoke as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">1. 'To (every) man that is born, an axe is born in his mouth, by which the fool cuts himself, when speaking bad language. (657)</p>

					<p class="f4">2. 'He who praises him who is to be blamed or blames him who as to be praised, gathers up sin in his mouth, and through that (sin) he will not find any joy. (658)</p>

					<p class="f4">4. 'Out of the one hundred thousand Nirabbudas (he goes) to thirty-six, and to five Abbudas; because he blames an Ariya he goes to hell, having employed his speech and mind badly. (660)</p>

					<p class="f4">5. 'He who speaks falsely goes to hell, or he who having done something says, "I have not done it;" both these after death become equal, in another world (they are both) men guilty of a mean deed.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn81" href="#n81">81</a>]</sup></span> (661)</p>

					<p class="f4">7. 'He who is given to the quality of covetousness, such a one censures others in his speech, (being himself) unbelieving, stingy, wanting in affability, niggardly, given to backbiting. (663)</p>

					<p class="ctr">The Isi Asita, also called Kaṇhasiri, on seeing the gods rejoicing, asks the cause of it, and having heard that Buddha has been born, he descends from Tusita heaven. When the Sakyas showed the child to him, he received it joyfully and prophesied <a id="pg125"><span class="f2 g"><b>[125]</b></span></a> about it. Buddha explains to Nālaka, the sister's son of Asita, the highest state of wisdom. — Compare Lalita-vistara, Adhyāya VII; <i>Asita and Buddha, or the Indian Simeon,</i> by J. Muir, in the <i>Indian Antiquary,</i> Sept. 1878.</p>

					<p class="fp4 ctr">Vatthugāthā.</p>

					<p class="f4">1. The Isi Asita saw in (their) resting-places during the day the joyful, delighted flocks of the Tidasa gods, and the gods in bright clothes, always highly praising Inda, after taking their clothes and waving them. (679)</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Seeing the gods with pleased minds, delighted, and showing his respect, he said this on that occasion: 'Why is the assembly of the gods so exceedingly pleased, why do they take their clothes and wave them? (680)</p>

					<p class="f4">3. 'When there was an encounter with the Asuras, a victory for the gods, and the Asuras were defeated, then there was not such a rejoicing. What wonderful (thing) have the gods seen that they are so delighted? (681)</p>

					<p class="f4">4. 'They shout and sing and make music, they throw (about their) arms and dance; I ask you, the inhabitants of the tops of (mount) Meru, remove my doubt quickly, O venerable ones!' (682)</p>

					<p class="f4">5. 'The Bodhisatta, the excellent pearl, the incomparable, is born for the good and for a blessing in the world of men, in the town of the Sakyas, in the country of Lumbinī. Therefore we are glad and exceedingly pleased. (683)</p>

					<p class="f4">6. 'He, the most excellent of all beings, the preeminent man, the bull of men, the most excellent of all creatures will turn the wheel (of the Dhamma) in the forest called after the Isis, (he who is) like the roaring lion, the strong lord of beasts.' (684)</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg126"><span class="f2 g"><b>[126]</b></span></a> 7. Having heard that noise he descended from (the heaven of) Tusita. Then he went to Suddhodana's palace, and having sat down there he said this to the Sakyas: 'Where is the prince? I wish to see (him).' (685)</p>

					<p class="f4">8. Then the Sakyas showed to (the Isi), called Asita, the child, the prince who was like shining gold, manufactured by a very skilful (smith) in the mouth of a forge, and beaming in glory and having a beautiful appearance. (686)</p>

					<p class="f4">9. Seeing the prince shining like fire, bright like the bull of stars wandering in the sky, like the burning sun in autumn, free from clouds, he joyfully obtained great delight. (687)</p>

					<p class="f4">10. The gods held in the sky a parasol with a thousand circles and numerous branches, yaks' tails with golden sticks were fanned, but those who held the yaks' tails and the parasol were not seen. (688)</p>

					<p class="f4">11. The Isi with the matted hair, by name Kaṇhasiri, on seeing the yellow blankets (shining) like a golden coin, and the white parasol held over his head, received him delighted and happy. (689)</p>

					<p class="f4">12. And having received the bull of the Sakyas, he who was wishing to receive him and knew the signs and the hymns, with pleased thoughts raised his voice, saying: 'Without superior is this, the most excellent of men.' (690)</p>

					<p class="f4">13. Then remembering his own migration he was displeased and shed tears; seeing this the Sakyas asked the weeping Isi, whether there would be any obstacle in the prince's path. (691)</p>

					<p class="f4">14. Seeing the Sakyas displeased the Isi said: 'I do not remember anything (that will be) unlucky for the prince, there will be no obstacles at <a id="pg127"><span class="f2 g"><b>[127]</b></span></a> all for him, for this is no inferior (person). Be without anxiety. (692)</p>

					<p class="f4">15.

					<p class="f4">16. 'My life here will shortly be at an end, in the middle (of his life) there will be death for me; I shall not hear the Dhamma of the incomparable one; therefore I am afflicted, unfortunate, and suffering.' (694)</p>

					<p class="f4">17. Having afforded the Sakyas great joy he went out from the interior of the town to lead a religious life; but taking pity on his sister's son, he induced him to embrace the Dhamma of the incomparable one. (695)</p>

					<p class="f4">18. 'When thou hearest from others the sound "Buddha," (or) "he who has acquired perfect enlightenment walks the way of the Dhamma," then going there and enquiring about the particulars, lead a religious life with that Bhagavat.' (696)</p>

					<p class="f4">19. Instructed by him, the friendly-minded, by one who saw in the future what is exceedingly pure (i.e. Nibbāna), he, Nālaka, with a heap of gathered-up good works, and with guarded senses dwelt (with him), looking forward to Gina (i.e. Buddha). (697)</p>

					<p class="f4">20. Hearing the noise, while the excellent Gina turned the wheel (of the Dhamma), and going and seeing the bull of the Isis, he, after being converted, <a id="pg128"><span class="f2 g"><b>[128]</b></span></a> asked the eminent Muni about the best wisdom, when the time of Asita's order had come.

					<p class="ctr">A description of disputing philosophers. The different schools of philosophy contradict each other, they proclaim different truths, but the truth is only one. As long as the disputations are going on, so long will there be strife in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">1. Abiding by their own views, some (people), having got into contest, assert themselves to be <a id="pg168"><span class="f2 g"><b>[168]</b></span></a> the (only) expert (saying), '(He) who understands this, he knows the Dhamma; he who reviles this, he is not perfect.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn162" href="#n162">162</a>]</sup></span> (878)</p>

					<p class="f4">2. So having got into contest they dispute: 'The opponent (is) a fool, an ignorant (person),' so they say. Which one of these, pray, is the true doctrine (vada)? for all these assert themselves (to be the only) expert. (879)</p>

					<p class="f4">3. He who does not acknowledge an opponent's doctrine (dhamma), he is a fool, a beast, one of poor understanding, all are fools with a very poor understanding; all these abide by their (own) views. (880)</p>

					<p class="f4">4. They are surely purified by their own view, they are of a pure understanding, expert, thoughtful, amongst them there is no one of poor understanding, their view is quite perfect! (881)</p>

					<p class="f4">5. I do not say, 'This is the reality,' which fools say mutually to each other; they made their own views the truth, therefore they hold others to be fools. (882)</p>

					<p class="f4">6. What some say is the truth, the reality, that others say is void, false, so having disagreed they dispute. Why do not the Samaṇas say one (and the same thing)? (883)</p>

					<p class="f4">7. For the truth is one, there is not a second, about which one intelligent man might dispute with another intelligent man; (but) they themselves praise different truths, therefore the Samaṇas do not say one and the same thing).<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn163" href="#n163">163</a>]</sup></span> (884)</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg169"><span class="f2 g"><b>[169]</b></span></a> 8. Why do the disputants that assert themselves (to be the only) expert, proclaim different truths? Have many different truths been heard of, or do they (only) follow (their own) reasoning? (885)</p>

					<p class="f4">9. There are not many different truths in the world, no eternal ones except consciousness; but having reasoned on the (philosophical) views they proclaim a double Dhamma, truth and falsehood.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn164" href="#n164">164</a>]</sup></span> (886)</p>

					<p class="f4">10. In regard to what has been seen, or heard, virtue and (holy) works, or what has been thought, and on account of these (views) looking (upon others) with contempt, standing in (their) resolutions joyful, they say that the opponent is a fool and an ignorant person (?)<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn165" href="#n165">165</a>]</sup></span> (887)</p>

					<p class="f4">11. Because he holds another (to be) a fool, therefore he calls himself expert, in his own opinion he is one that tells what is propitious, others he blames, so he said.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn166" href="#n166">166</a>]</sup></span> (?) (888)</p>

					<p class="f4">12. He is full of his overbearing (philosophical) view, mad with pride, thinking himself perfect, he is in his own opinion anointed with the spirit (of genius), for his (philosopbical) view is quite complete. (889)</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg170"><span class="f2 g"><b>[170]</b></span></a> 13. If he according to another's report is low, then (he says) the other is also of a low understanding, and if he himself is accomplished and wise, there is not any fool amongst the Samaṇas.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn167" href="#n167">167</a>]</sup></span> (890)</p>

					<p class="f4">14. 'Those who preach a doctrine (dhamma) different from this, fall short of purity and are imperfect,' so the Titthiyas say repeatedly, for they are inflamed by passion for their own (philosophical) views. (891)</p>

					<p class="f4">15. Here they maintain purity, in other doctrines (dhamma) they do not allow purity; so the Titthiyas, entering extensively (upon details), say that in their own way there is something firm. (892)</p>

					<p class="f4">16. And saying that there is something firm in his own way he holds his opponent to be a fool; thus he himself brings on strife, calling his opponent a fool and impure (asuddhadhamma). (893)</p>

					<p class="f4">17. Standing in (his) resolution, having himself measured (teachers, etc), he still more enters into dispute in the world; but having left all resolutions nobody will excite strife in the world.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn168" href="#n168">168</a>]</sup></span> (894)</p>

					<p class="ctr">Philosophers cannot lead to purity, they only praise themselves and stigmatise others. But a Brāhmaṇa has overcome all dispute, he is indifferent to learning, he is appeased.</p>

					<p class="f4">1. Those who abiding in the (philosophical) views dispute, saying, 'This is the truth,' they all incur blame, and they also obtain praise in this matter. (895)</p>

					<p class="f4">2. This is little, not enough to (bring about) tranquillity, I say there are two fruits of dispute; having seen this let no one dispute, understanding Khema (i.e. Nibbāna) to be the place where there is no dispute. (896)</p>

					<p class="f4">6. Having left virtue and (holy) works altogether, and both wrong and blameless work, not praying for purity or impurity, he wanders abstaining (from both purity and impurity), without having embraced peace. (900)</p>

					<p class="f4">7. By means of penance, or anything disliked, or what has been seen, or heard, or thought, going upwards they wail for what is pure, without being free from desire for reiterated existence. (901)</p>

					<p class="f4">8. For him who wishes (for something there always are) desires,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn171" href="#n171">171</a>]</sup></span> and trembling in (the midst of his) plans; he for whom there is no death and no re-birth, how can he tremble or desire anything? (902)</p>

					<p class="f4">9. What some call the highest Dhamma, that others again call wretched; which one of these, pray, is the true doctrine (vada)? for all these assert themselves (to be the only) expert. (903)</p>

					<p class="f4">10. Their own Dhamma they say is perfect, another's Dhamma again they say is wretched; so having disagreed they dispute, they each say their own opinions (are) the truth. (904)</p>

					<p class="f4">11. If one (becomes) low by another's censure, then there will be no one distinguished amongst the Dhammas; for they all say another's Dhamma (is) low, in their own they say there is something firm.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn172" href="#n172">172</a>]</sup></span> (905)</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg173"><span class="f2 g"><b>[173]</b></span></a> 12.

					<p class="f4">13. There is nothing about a Brāhmaṇa dependent upon others, nothing amongst the Dhammas which he would embrace after investigation; therefore he has overcome the disputes, for he does not regard any other Dhamma as the best. (907)</p>

					<p class="f4">14. 'I understand, I see likewise this,' so saying, some by (their philosophical) views return to purity. If he saw purity, what then (has been effected) by another's view? Having conquered they say that purity exists by another.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn174" href="#n174">174</a>]</sup></span> (?) (908)</p>

					<p class="f4">15. A seeing man will see name and form, and having seen he will understand those (things); let him at pleasure see much or little, for the expert do not say that purity exists by that. (909)</p>

					<p class="f4">16. A dogmatist is no leader to purity, being guided by prejudiced views, saying that good consists in what he is given to, and saying that purity is there, he saw the thing so.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn175" href="#n175">175</a>]</sup></span> (910)</p>

(911)</p>

					<p class="f4">18. The Muni, having done away with ties here in the world, is no partisan in the disputes that have arisen; appeased amongst the unappeased he is indifferent, not embracing learning, while others acquire it. (912)</p>

					<p class="f4">19. Having abandoned his former passions, not contracting new ones, not wandering according to his wishes, being no dogmatist, he is delivered from the (philosophical) views, being wise, and he does not cling to the world, neither does he blame himself. (913)</p>

					<p class="f4">20. Being secluded amongst all the doctrines (dhamma), whatever has been seen, heard, or thought, he is a Muni who has laid down his burden and is liberated, not belonging to time (na kappiyo), not dead, not wishing for anything. So said Bhagavat. (914)</p>

					<p class="f4">1. From him who has seized a stick fear arises. Look at people killing (each other); I will tell of grief as it is known to me. (935)</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Seeing people struggling like fish in (a pond with) little water, seeing them obstructed by each other, a fear came over me. (936)</p>

					<p class="f4">3. The world is completely unsubstantial, all quarters are shaken; wishing for a house for myself I did not see (one) uninhabited. (937)</p>

					<p class="f4">4. But having seen (all beings) in the end obstructed, discontent arose in me; then I saw in <a id="pg178"><span class="f2 g"><b>[178]</b></span></a> this world an arrow, difficult to see, stuck in the heart. (938)</p>

					<p class="f4">5. He who has been pierced by this arrow runs through all quarters; but having drawn out that arrow, he will not run, he will sit down (quietly). (939)</p>

					<p class="f4">6. There (many) studies are gone through; what is tied in the world let him not apply himself to (untie) it; having wholly transfixed desire, let him learn his own extinction (Nibbāna). (940)</p>

					<p class="f4">7. Let the Muni be truthful, without arrogance, undeceitful, free from slander, not angry, let him overcome avarice. (941)</p>

					<p class="f4">8. Let the man who has turned his mind to Nibbāna conquer sleepiness, drowsiness, and sloth; let him not live together with indolence, let him not indulge in conceit. (942)</p>

					<p class="f4">9. Let him not be led into falsehood, let him not turn his affection to form; let him penetrate arrogance, let him wander abstaining from violence. (943)</p>

					<p class="f4">13. He indeed is wise, he is accomplished, having understood the Dhamma independent (of everything); wandering rightly in the world he does not envy any one here. (947)</p>

					<p class="f4">16. The man who has no desire at all for name and form (individuality) and who does not grieve over what is no more, he indeed does not decay in the world.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn188" href="#n188">188</a>]</sup></span> (950)</p>

					<p class="ctr">To the Brāhmaṇa Bāvarī, living on the banks of the Godhāvaī, in Assaka's territory, comes another Brāhmaṇa and asks for five hundred pieces of money, but not getting them he curses Bāvarī, saying, 'May thy head on the seventh day hence cleave into seven.' A deity comforts Bāvarī by referring him to Buddha. Then Bāvarī sends his sixteen disciples to Buddha, and each of thern asks Buddha a question.</p>

					<p class="f4">1. From the beautiful city of the Kosalas (Sāvatthī) a Brāhmaṇa, well versed in the hymns, went to the South (Dakkhiṇāpatha) wishing for nothingness.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn201" href="#n201">201</a>]</sup></span> (976)</p>

					<p class="f4">3. And close by the bank there was a large village, with the income of which he prepared a great sacrifice. (978)</p>

					<p class="f4">4. Having offered the great sacrifice, he again entered the hermitage. Upon his re-entering, another Brāhmaṇa arrived, (979)</p>

					<p class="f4">5. With swollen feet,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn202" href="#n202">202</a>]</sup></span> trembling, covered with mud, with dust on his head. And he going up <a id="pg185"><span class="f2 g"><b>[185]</b></span></a> to him (i.e. the first Brāhmaṇa) demanded five hundred (pieces of money). (980)</p>

					<p class="f4">6. Bāvarī, seeing him, bade him be seated, asked him whether he was happy and well, and spoke as follows: (981)</p>

					<p class="f4">7. 'What gifts I had are all given away by me; pardon me, O Brāhmaṇa, I have no five hundred.' (982)</p>

					<p class="f4">8. 'If thou wilt not give to me who asks, may thy head on the seventh clay cleave into seven.' (983)</p>

					<p class="f4">9. So after the usual ceremonies this impostor made known his fearful (curse). On hearing these his words Bāvarī became sorrowful. (984)</p>

					<p class="f4">10. He wasted away taking no food, transfixed by the arrow of grief, but yet his mind delighted in meditation. (985)</p>

					<p class="f4">11. Seeing Bāvarī struck with horror and sorrowful, the benevolent deity (of that place) approached him and said as follows: (986)</p>

					<p class="f4">12. 'He does not know (anything about) the head; he is a hypocrite coveting riches; knowledge of the head and head-splitting is not found in him.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn203" href="#n203">203</a>]</sup></span> (987)</p>

					<p class="f4">14. 'I do not know this; knowledge of it is not found in me; as to the head and head-splitting, this is to be seen by Buddhas (only).' (989)</p>

					<p class="f4">15. 'Who then, say, in the circumference of the <a id="pg186"><span class="f2 g"><b>[186]</b></span></a> earth knows the head and head-splitting, tell me that, O deity?' (990)</p>

					<p class="f4">16. 'Formerly went out from Kapilavatthu a ruler of the world, an offspring of the Okkaka king, the Sakya son, the light-giving; (991)</p>

					<p class="f4">17. 'He is, O Brāhmaṇa, the perfectly Enlightened (Sambuddha); perfect in all things, he has attained the power of all knowledge, sees clearly in everything; he has arrived at the destruction of all things, and is liberated in the destruction of the upadhis.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn204" href="#n204">204</a>]</sup></span> (992)</p>

					<p class="f4">19. Having heard the word 'Sambuddha,' Bāvarī rejoiced, his grief became little, and he was filled with great delight. (994)</p>

					<p class="f4">20. Bāvarī glad, rejoicing, and eager asked the deity: 'In what village or in what town or in what province dwells the chief of the world, that going there we may adore the perfectly Enlightened, the first of men?' (995)</p>

					<p class="f4">23. 'He whose appearance in the world is difficult to be met with often, he is at the present time<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn205" href="#n205">205</a>]</sup></span> <a id="pg187"><span class="f2 g"><b>[187]</b></span></a> born in the world and widely renowned as Sambuddha (the perfectly Enlightened); go quickly to Sāvatthī and behold the best of men.'

					<p class="f4">43. 'Tell me about (my master's) birth, tell me about his family together with the marks, tell me about his perfection in the hymns, how many (hymns) does the Brāhmaṇa recite?' (1018)</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg189"><span class="f2 g"><b>[189]</b></span></a> 44. Bhagavat said: 'One hundred and twenty years (is his) age, and by family he is a Bāvarī; three are his marks on the limbs, and in the three Vedas he is perfect. (1019)</p>

Piŋgiya, who sat picturing Buddha's virtues to Bāvarī, having seen the light, looked round, saying, 'What is this?' And when he saw Bhagavat standing, as it were, before him, he said to the Brāhmaṇa Bāvarī: 'Buddha has come.' The Brāhmaṇa rose from his seat and stood with folded hands. Bhagavat, shedding a light, showed himself to the Brāhmaṇa, and knowing what was beneficial for both, he said this stanza while addressing Piŋgiya. Commentator.</p>
