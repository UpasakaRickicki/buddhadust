					when the Blessed One was newly Self-awakened,<br />
					he was staying at <a id="Uruvela">Uruvela</a><br />
					on the bank of the <a id="neranjara">Nerañjara River</a>,<br />
					at the foot of the Goatherd's Banyan Tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, while he was alone and in seclusion,<br />
					this line of thinking arose in his awareness:</p>

					<p class="f4">"One suffers if dwelling without reverence or deference.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on what priest or contemplative can I dwell in dependence,<br />
					honoring and respecting him?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the thought occurred to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It would be for the sake of perfecting<br />
					an unperfected aggregate of virtue<br />
					that I would dwell in dependence on another priest or contemplative,<br />
					honoring and respecting him.</p>

					<p class="f4">However, in this world with its devas,<br />
					Maras, and Brahmās,<br />
					in this generation with its priests and contemplatives,<br />
					its royalty and common-folk,<br />
					I do not see another priest or contemplative<br />
					more consummate in virtue than I,<br />
					on whom I could dwell in dependence,<br />
					honoring and respecting him.</p>

					<p class="f4">"It would be for the sake of perfecting<br />
					an unperfected aggregate of concentration<br />
					that I would dwell in dependence on another priest or contemplative,<br />
					honoring and respecting him.</p>

					<p class="f4">However, in this world with its devas,<br />
					Maras, and Brahmās,<br />
					in this generation with its priests and contemplatives,<br />
					its royalty and common-folk,<br />
					I do not see another priest or contemplative<br />
					more consummate in virtue than I,<br />
					on whom I could dwell in dependence,<br />
					honoring and respecting him.</p>

					<p class="f4">"It would be for the sake of perfecting<br />
					an unperfected aggregate of discernment<br />
					that I would dwell in dependence on another priest or contemplative,<br />
					honoring and respecting him.</p>

					<p class="f4">However, in this world with its devas,<br />
					Maras, and Brahmās,<br />
					in this generation with its priests and contemplatives,<br />
					its royalty and common-folk,<br />
					I do not see another priest or contemplative<br />
					more consummate in virtue than I,<br />
					on whom I could dwell in dependence,<br />
					honoring and respecting him.</p>

					<p class="f4">"It would be for the sake of perfecting<br />
					an unperfected aggregate of release<br />
					that I would dwell in dependence on another priest or contemplative,<br />
					honoring and respecting him.</p>

					<p class="f4">However, in this world with its devas,<br />
					Maras, and Brahmās,<br />
					in this generation with its priests and contemplatives,<br />
					its royalty and common-folk,<br />
					I do not see another priest or contemplative<br />
					more consummate in virtue than I,<br />
					on whom I could dwell in dependence,<br />
					honoring and respecting him.</p>

					<p class="f4">"It would be for the sake of perfecting<br />
					an unperfected aggregate of knowledge and vision of release<br />
					that I would dwell in dependence on another priest or contemplative,<br />
					honoring and respecting him.</p>

					<p class="f4">However, in this world with its devas,<br />
					Maras, and Brahmās,<br />
					in this generation with its priests and contemplatives,<br />
					its royalty and common-folk,<br />
					I do not see another priest or contemplative<br />
					more consummate in virtue than I,<br />
					on whom I could dwell in dependence,<br />
					honoring and respecting him.</p>

					<p class="f4">"What if I were to dwell in dependence on this very Dhamma<br />
					to which I have fully awakened,<br />
					honoring and respecting it?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, having known with his own awareness the line of thinking in the Blessed One's awareness —<br />
					just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm<br />
					or flex his extended arm —<br />
					Brahmā Sahampati disappeared from the Brahmā-world<br />
					and reappeared in front of the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Arranging his upper robe over one shoulder,<br />
					he saluted the Blessed One with his hands before his heart and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"So it is, Blessed One!</p>

					<p class="f4">So it is, One-Well-Gone!</p>

					<p class="f4">Those who were Arahants,<br />
					Rightly Self-awakened Ones in the past —<br />
					they, too, dwelled in dependence on the very Dhamma itself,<br />
					honoring and respecting it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those who will be Arahants,<br />
					Rightly Self-awakened Ones in the future —<br />
					they, too, will dwell in dependence on the very Dhamma itself,<br />
					honoring and respecting it.</p>

					<p class="f4">And let the Blessed One,<br />
					who is at present the Arahant,<br />
					the Rightly Self-awakened One,<br />
					dwell in dependence on the very Dhamma itself,<br />
					honoring and respecting it."</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what Brahmā Sahampati said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having said that, he further said this:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Past Buddhas,<br />
					future Buddhas,<br />
					and he who is the Buddha now,<br />
					removing the sorrow of many —</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">all have dwelt,<br />
					will dwell, he dwells,<br />
					revering the true Dhamma.<br />
					This, for Buddhas, is a natural law.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Therefore one who desires his own good,<br />
					aspiring for greatness,<br />
					should respect the true Dhamma,<br />
					recollecting the Buddhas' Teaching.</p>
