There the Blessed One addressed the monks: "I will teach you the origination of the world and the ending of the world. Listen and pay close attention. I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As you say, lord," the monks responded to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said: "And what is the origination of the world? Dependent on the eye and forms there arises eye-consciousness. The meeting of the three is contact. From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling. From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving. From craving as a requisite condition comes clinging/sustenance. From clinging/sustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming. From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth. From birth as a requisite condition, then aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair come into play. This is the origination of the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Dependent on the ear and sounds there arises ear-consciousness. The meeting of the three is contact... Dependent on the nose and aromas there arises nose-consciousness. The meeting of the three is contact... Dependent on the tongue and flavors there arises tongue-consciousness. The meeting of the three is contact... Dependent on the body and tactile sensations there arises body-consciousness. The meeting of the three is contact... Dependent on the intellect and mental qualities there arises intellect-consciousness. The meeting of the three is contact. From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling. From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving. From craving as a requisite condition comes clinging/sustenance. From clinging/sustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming. From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth. From birth as a requisite condition, then aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair come into play. This is the origination of the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the ending of the world? Dependent on the eye and forms there arises eye-consciousness. The meeting of the three is contact. From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling. From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving. Now, from the remainderless cessation and fading away of that very craving comes the cessation of clinging/sustenance. From the cessation of clinging/sustenance comes the cessation of becoming. From the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth. From the cessation of birth, then aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair all cease. Such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress and suffering. This is the ending of the world.</p>
