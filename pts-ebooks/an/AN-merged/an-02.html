					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="#9_p1" id="p1">1</a>]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="#10_savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> at <a href="#10_jetavana">Jeta Grove,</a> in Anāthapiṇḍika&apos;s Park.<br/>
					Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Lord,&apos; replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Monks, there are these two faults.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#1_n2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					What two?</p>

					<p class="f4">That which has its result<br/>
					in this very life,<br/>
					and that which has its result<br/>
					in some future life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, what is a fault<br/>
					that has its result<br/>
					in this very life?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this connexion, monks,<br/>
					one sees rulers seize a robber,<br/>
					a miscreant,<br/>
					and subjecting [sic] him<br/>
					to divers forms of punishment:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#1_n3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					flogging him with whips,<br/>
					with canes,<br/>
					with cudgels:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#1_n4" id="fn4">4</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					cutting off his hand,<br/>
					his foot,<br/>
					hand and foot,<br/>
					his ear,<br/>
					nose,<br/>
					ear and nose:<br/>
					torturing him with the &quot;gruel-pot,&quot;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#1_n5" id="fn5">5</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					with the &quot;chankshave,&quot;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#1_n6" id="fn6">6</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					torturing him with &quot;Rāhu&apos;s mouth,&quot;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#1_n7" id="fn7">7</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					with the &quot;fire- <a id="1_pg43"><span class="f2 g"><b>[43]</b></span></a> garland,&quot;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#1_n8" id="fn8">8</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					with the &quot;flaming hand,&quot;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#1_n9" id="fn9">9</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					with the &quot;hay-twist,&quot;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#1_n10" id="fn10">10</a>]</sup></span> the &quot;bark-dress,&quot;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#1_n11" id="fn11">11</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					&quot;the antelope&quot;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#1_n12" id="fn12">12</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					with &quot;flesh-hooking,&quot;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#1_n13" id="fn13">13</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					with the &quot;disc-slice,&quot;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#1_n14" id="fn14">14</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					with the &quot;pickling process,&quot;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#1_n15" id="fn15">15</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					with &quot;circling the pin,&quot;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#1_n16" id="fn16">16</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					with the &quot;straw mattress.&quot;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#1_n17" id="fn17">17</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then they spray him with boiling oil,<br/>
					give him as food to dogs,<br/>
					spit him alive on a stake<br/>
					or chop his head off.</p>

					<p class="f4">The observer (of all this) thinks thus:<br/>
					If I were to do such deeds<br/>
					as those <a id="1_hetu">for which</a> the rulers seize a robber,<br/>
					a miscreant,<br/>
					and so treat him ...<br/>
					they would surely treat me in like manner.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus scared at the thought<br/>
					of a fault (which has its result) in this very life,<br/>
					he goes not about<br/>
					plundering others&apos; property.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/>
					&quot;a fault with immediate retribution.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is<br/>
					a fault with future retribution?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this connexion<br/>
					someone may thus reflect:<br/>
					Evil in the future life<br/>
					is the fruit of bodily offence.<br/>
					Evil is the fruit of offence by word,<br/>
					by &apos;thought,<br/>
					in the future life.<br/>
					If I offend in deed,<br/>
					in word,<br/>
					in thought,<br/>
					should not I,<br/>
					when body breaks up,<br/>
					after death<br/>
					be reborn in the Waste,<br/>
					the Way of Woe,<br/>
					the Downfall,<br/>
					in Purgatory?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="1_pg44"><span class="f2 g"><b>[44]</b></span></a> Thus scared at the thought<br/>
					of a fault to be atoned for in a future life,<br/>
					he abandons immorality<br/>
					in deeds of body<br/>
					and practises morality<br/>
					in deeds of body:<br/>
					abandons immorality<br/>
					in the practice of speech and thought,<br/>
					and cultivates morality therein<br/>
					and conducts himself<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#1_n18" id="fn18">18</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					with utter purity.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/>
					&quot;a fault with future retribution.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the two faults.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, I say unto you:<br/>
					Thus must ye train yourselves:<br/>
					— &quot;We will fear faults with immediate,<br/>
					we will fear faults with future retribution.<br/>
					We will shun<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#1_n19" id="fn19">19</a>]</sup></span> faults,<br/>
					we will see danger in faults.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">Of one who does so, monks,<br/>
					it may be expected<br/>
					that he will be released from all faults.</p>
					
					<h4 class="ctr c">Sutta 2. Untitled</h4>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="#9_p2" id="p2">2</a>]</span> Monks, these two struggles<br/>
					are hard to undergo in the world.<br/>
					What two?</p>

					<p class="f4">The struggle of householders<br/>
					who live at home<br/>
					to provide clothing, food, lodging,<br/>
					medicines for the sick,<br/>
					and provision of necessaries:<br/>
					and the struggle of those<br/>
					who have gone forth from home to the homeless,<br/>
					to renounce all substrates of rebirth.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the two struggles ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Of these two, monks,<br/>
					the latter is the more important.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore I say unto you:<br/>
					Thus must ye train yourselves: —<br/>
					&quot;We will undertake the struggle<br/>
					to renounce all substrates of rebirth.&quot;<br/>

					He is seared (with remorse)<br/>
					at the thought:<br/>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="#9_p5" id="p5">5</a>][<a href="#11_">than</a>]</span> Two things, monks,<br/>

					<p class="f4">By my earnest endeavour, monks,<br/>

					To begin with the Pali is different in PTS, BJT and VRI.<br/>
					Woodward and the PTS text in the Pali has it for 289 and following:<br/>

					2. The control of ill-conditioned monks and the comfort of good monks<br/>
					...3...etc.<br/>

					1. The Obligations<br/>
					2. The Recitation of the Obligations<br/>
					3. and the following 27 concepts.&quot;<br/>
					His conclusion is a repeat of the question, not the usual statement of the conclusion.<br/>
					BJT has it in the only way it makes sense:<br/>
					289 ~:<br/>
					&quot;...to bring about this pair of results the [Obligation] was enjoined on his disciples...what two?

					<h4>Editor&apos;s Note:</h4>

					<p>There is a major mess-up in the numbering of AN 2 up passed sutta #289, the second chapter of Vagga XVII.<br/>
					To begin with the Pali is different in PTS, BJT and VRI.<br/>
					Woodward and the PTS text in the Pali has it for 289 and following:<br/>
					&quot;...to bring about 1. The excellence and well-bring of the Order;<br/>
					2. The control of ill-conditioned monks and the comfort of good monks<br/>
					...3...etc.<br/>
					the following have been enjoined on his disciples. [Woodward and PTS omit what would be required for their ordering, the: &apos;What following?&apos;]<br/>
					1. The Obligations<br/>
					2. The Recitation of the Obligations<br/>
					3. and the following 27 concepts.&quot;<br/>
					His conclusion is a repeat of the question, not the usual statement of the conclusion.<br/>
					BJT has it in the only way it makes sense:<br/>
					289 ~:<br/>
					&quot;...to bring about this pair of results the [Obligation] was enjoined on his disciples...what two?
					The excellence and well-bring of the Order.&quot;<br/>
					&quot;...to bring about this pair of results the [Obligation] was enjoined on his disciples...what two?<br/>
					The control of ill-conditioned monks and the comfort of good monks<br/>
					...3...etc.<br/>
					&quot;...to bring about this pair of results the [the recitation of the Obligation] was enjoined on his disciples...what two?<br/>
					The excellence and well-bring of the Order.&quot;<br/>
					&quot;...to bring about this pair of results the [the recitation of the Obligation] was enjoined on his disciples...what two?<br/>
					The control of ill-conditioned monks and the comfort of good monks<br/>
					...3...etc.<br/>
					And on through the remaining 27 giving for each, each of the pairs, one sutta for each.<br/>
					Correcting Woodward to comply with the text went beyond the scope of the intent here to fully present the suttas according to Woodward by expanding to fill out abbreviated passages and so this alternative page was created for those wishing to see this section in the correctly expanded form following Woodward&apos;s vocabulary.</p>
