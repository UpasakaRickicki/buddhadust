					<p class="f4">Once<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#216_n1" id="fn1">1</a>]</sup></span> the Exalted One walked a walk<br/>

					<p class="f4">And there in the Icchānaṇgala grove the Exalted One dwelt.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the brahman householders of that place heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Having realized more-knowledge himself,<br/>

					to this earth with its recluses and brahmans,<br/>

					lovely in the beginning,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time Seta,<br/>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="#303_p1" id="p1">1</a>]</span> Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once, while the Exalted One was dwelling on Mount Vulture Peak near <a href="#10_rajagaha">Rājagaha,</a><br/>
					the venerable Dhammika was<br/>
					a lodger in his native district.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#302_n2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And there were there altogether seven settlements.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#302_n3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Dhammika went about insulting the monks who visited,<br/>
					reviling them,<br/>
					annoying them,<br/>
					nudging them,<br/>
					vexing them with talk;<br/>
					and they,<br/>
					insulted,<br/>
					reviled,<br/>
					annoyed,<br/>
					nudged,<br/>
					vexed with talk;<br/>
					departed,<br/>
					nor settled there,<br/>
					but quitted the lodging.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the local<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#302_n2">2</a>]</sup></span> lay-disciples thought to themselves:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;We&apos;re <a id="302_pg261"><span class="f2 g"><b>[261]</b></span></a> ready enough<br/>
					with the requisites -<br/>
					robe,<br/>
					alms,<br/>
					lodpng,<br/>
					medicaments -<br/>
					for the Order;<br/>
					yet visiting monks depart,<br/>
					nor settle here,<br/>
					but quit the lodging.</p>

					<p class="f4">What&apos;s the cause and reason for this?&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">And they thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;It&apos;s the venerable Dhammika!</p>

					<p class="f4">He insults the monks,<br/>
					reviles them<br/>
					annoys them,<br/>
					nudges them,<br/>
					and vexes them with talk.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose we send him forth.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">So they went to the venerable Dhammika<br/>
					and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Sir, let the venerable Dhammika depart,<br/>
					long enough has he lodged here!&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Dhammika left that lodging<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">There, too, the venerable Dhammika went about insulting the monks who visited,<br/>

					<p class="f4">What&apos;s the cause and reason for this?&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">So they went to the venerable Dhammika<br/>
					and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Sir, let the venerable Dhammika<br/>
					leave all seven local lodgings!&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then thought the venerable Dhammika:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;I am sent forth by the local lay-disciples<br/>
					from all seven lodgings of my birthplace;<br/>
					where shall I go now?&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">And he thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">What if I visit the Exalted One?</p>

					<p class="f4">So the venerable Dhammika,<br/>
					with robe and bowl,<br/>
					departed for Rājagaha,<br/>
					and in due time<br/>
					came to Mount Vulture Peak<br/>
					near Rājagaha;<br/>
					and approaching the Exalted One,<br/>
					saluted<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One said to him,<br/>
					so seated:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Well, brāhman Dhammika,<br/>
					whence come you?&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Lord, I have been sent forth by the local lay-folk<br/>
					from the seven lodgings of my native district.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Come now, brāhman Dhammika,<br/>
					what&apos;s that to you?</p>

					<p class="f4">No matter where they have sent you forth<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#302_n4" id="fn4">4</a>]</sup></span> from,<br/>
					you have gone forth<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#302_n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					thence to come to me!</p>

					<p class="f4">In<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#302_n5" id="fn5">5</a>]</sup></span> times past, brāhman Dhammika,<br/>
					when seafaring <a id="302_pg262"><span class="f2 g"><b>[262]</b></span></a> merchants put to sea in ships,<br/>
					they took with them<br/>
					a bird to sight land.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the ship was out of sight of land,<br/>
					they freed the bird;<br/>
					and it flew eastward<br/>
					and westward,<br/>
					northward<br/>
					and southward,<br/>
					upward<br/>
					and around.</p>

					<p class="f4">And if the bird sighted land near by,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#302_n6" id="fn6">6</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					it was gone for good;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#302_n7" id="fn7">7</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					but if the bird saw no land,<br/>
					it returned to the ship.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, brāhman Dhammika,<br/>
					no matter where they have sent you forth from,<br/>
					you have gone forth<br/>
					thence to come to me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Long ago, brāhman Dhammika,<br/>
					rajah Koravya<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#302_n8" id="fn8">8</a>]</sup></span> had a king-banyan tree called Steadfast,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#302_n9" id="fn9">9</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					and the shade of its widespread<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#302_n10" id="fn10">10</a>]</sup></span> branches<br/>
					was cool and lovely.</p>

					<p class="f4">Its shelter broadened to twelve leagues,<br/>
					its roots spread to five<br/>
					and the great fruit thereof was in keeping -<br/>
					as big as pipkins<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#302_n11" id="fn11">11</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					was the sweet fruit,<br/>
					clear and as sweet as the honey of bees.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#302_n12" id="fn12">12</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And the rajah and his concubines<br/>
					enjoyed one portion of Steadfast,<br/>
					the army another;<br/>
					the town and Country folk<br/>
					enjoyed one portion,<br/>
					recluses and godly men<br/>
					one portion,<br/>
					and one portion<br/>
					the beasts and birds enjoyed.</p>

					<p class="f4">None guarded its fruit<br/>
					and none hurt another<br/>
					for its fruit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now there came a man<br/>
					who ate his fill of fruit,<br/>
					broke a branch<br/>
					and Went his way.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thought the deva dwelling in Steadfast:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;How amazing,<br/>
					how astonishing it is,<br/>
					that a man should be so evil<br/>
					as to break a branch off Steadfast,<br/>
					after eating his fill!</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose Steadfast<br/>
					were to bear no more fruit!&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">And Steadfast bore no more fruit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, brāhman Dhammika,<br/>
					rajah Koravya visited Sakka,<br/>
					king of devas,<br/>
					and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Pray, your grace,<br/>
					know you that Steadfast,<br/>
					the king-banyan tree,<br/>
					bears no fruit?&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="302_pg263"><span class="f2 g"><b>[263]</b></span></a> And Sakka, the deva-king,<br/>
					worked a work of mystic power<br/>
					so that there came<br/>
					a mighty wind and rain<br/>
					which smote Steadfast<br/>
					and overturned him.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the deva dwelling there<br/>
					was full of grief and despair<br/>
					and stood beside Steadfast,<br/>
					weeping and lamenting.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then brāhman Dhammika,<br/>
					the deva-king, Sakka,<br/>
					approached the deva of the banyan tree<br/>
					and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">What ails thee, deva?</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Your grace, a mighty squall has come<br/>
					and overturned my home.&apos;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#302_n13" id="fn13">13</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Came that squall, deva,<br/>
					whilst thou<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#302_n14" id="fn14">14</a>]</sup></span> keptest tree-Dhamma?&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;But how, your grace,<br/>
					keeps a tree<br/>
					tree-Dhamma?&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Just thus, deva:</p>

					<p class="f4">The grubber takes the roots,<br/>
					the stripper the bark,<br/>
					the plucker the leaves,<br/>
					the picker the fruit,<br/>
					nor therefore is there any cause<br/>
					for the deva to mope and pine -<br/>
					thus keeps a tree tree-Dhamma.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Your grace, I was not keeping tree-Dhamma,<br/>
					when the squall came<br/>
					and smote and overturned my home.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Yet, deva,<br/>
					shouldst thou keep tree-Dhamma,<br/>
					thy home would be as of yore.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Then I will keep tree-Dhamma, your grace;<br/>
					let my home be as of yore!&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">And, brāhman Dhammika,<br/>
					the deva-king, Sakka,<br/>
					worked a work of mystic power<br/>
					and there came a mighty wind and rain<br/>
					which set up Steadfast,<br/>
					the king-banyan tree,<br/>
					and healed<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#302_n15" id="fn15">15</a>]</sup></span> his roots.</p>

					<p class="f4">Did you, even so, brāhman Dhammika,<br/>
					keep recluse-Dhamma,<br/>
					when the local lay-folk sent you forth<br/>
					from each of the seven lodgings<br/>
					of your birthplace?&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;But how, lord, keeps a recluse<br/>
					recluse-Dhamma?&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Thuswise, brāhman Dhammika:</p>

					<p class="f4">A recluse returns not <a id="302_pg264"><span class="f2 g"><b>[264]</b></span></a> the insult of the insulter,<br/>
					the anger of the angry,<br/>
					the abuse of the abuser<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#302_n16" id="fn16">16</a>]</sup></span> -<br/>
					thus keeps a recluse<br/>
					recluse-Dhamma.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Too true, lord,<br/>
					I kept not recluse-Dhamma<br/>
					when the local lay-folk<br/>
					sent me forth from the seven lodgings.&quot;</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="#319_p1" id="p1">1</a>][<a href="#320_p1">than</a>]</span> Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once, when the Exalted One was dwelling near <a href="#10_rajagaha">Rājagaha,</a>,<br/>
					on Mount Vulture Peak,<br/>
					the venerable Sona<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#318_n1" id="fn1">1</a>]</sup></span> dwelt on Cool Wood<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#318_n2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					near Rājagaha.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Sona,<br/>
					in solitude apart,<br/>
					communed thus in his heart:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">&apos;The Exalted one&apos;s disciples live in active energy<br/>
					and I am one of them;<br/>
					yet my heart is not detached<br/>
					and free of the cankers.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">My family is rich<br/>
					and I can enjoy riches and do good;<br/>
					what if I were to forsake the training<br/>
					and turn to low things,<br/>
					enjoy riches and do good!&apos;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One,<br/>
					knowing in his own heart<br/>
					the venerable Sona&apos;s thoughts<br/>
					— as a strong man might stretch his bent arm<br/>
					or bend his stretched arm —<br/>
					left Mount Vulture Peak<br/>
					and appeared in Cool Wood<br/>
					before the venerable Sona.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when <a id="318_pg267"><span class="f2 g"><b>[267]</b></span></a> his seat was ready,<br/>
					the Exalted One sat down;<br/>
					and the venerable Sona,<br/>
					after saluting,<br/>
					also sat down — at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One said to him, so seated:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Sona, did you not thus commune in your heart:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">&quot;The Exalted one&apos;s disciples live in active energy<br/>
					and I am one of them;<br/>
					yet my heart is not detached<br/>
					and free of the cankers.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">My family is rich<br/>
					and I can enjoy riches and do good;<br/>
					what if I were to forsake the training<br/>
					and turn to low things,<br/>
					enjoy riches and do good!&quot;</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Yes, lord.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Bethink you, Sona,<br/>
					were you not, in the old days at home,<br/>
					clever at the lute&apos;s stringed music?&apos;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#318_n3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, lord.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;And bethink you, Sona,<br/>
					when your lute&apos;s strings were over-strung,<br/>
					was your lute then tuneful and playable?&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">No, indeed, lord.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;And bethink you, Sona,<br/>
					when your lute&apos;s strings were over-lax,<br/>

					<p class="f4">No, indeed, lord.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;But when, Sona,<br/>
					your lute&apos;s strings were neither over-strung<br/>
					nor over-lax,<br/>
					but keyed to the middle pitch,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#318_n4" id="fn4">4</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					was your lute then tuneful and playable?&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">Surely, lord</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Even so, Sona,<br/>
					energy, when over-strung,<br/>
					ends in flurry,<br/>
					when over-lax,<br/>
					in idleness.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Sona,<br/>
					stand fast in the mean<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#318_n5" id="fn5">5</a>]</sup></span> of energy;<br/>
					pierce the mean (in the use) of the faculties;<br/>

					<p class="f4"><a id="318_pg268"><span class="f2 g"><b>[268]</b></span></a> &apos;Yes, lord.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One,<br/>
					after charging the venerable Sona with this counsel<br/>
					— as a strong man might bend his arm to and fro —<br/>
					left Cool Wood<br/>
					and appeared on Mount Vulture Peak.</p>

					<p class="f4">And presently<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#318_n7" id="fn7">7</a>]</sup></span> the venerable Sona stood fast in the mean of energy;<br/>
					pierced the mean in the faculties;<br/>
					and grasped therein the mark;<br/>
					and living alone, secluded,<br/>
					earnest, ardent, resolute,<br/>
					entered and abode, not long after,<br/>
					here amid things seen,<br/>
					by his own power,<br/>
					in the realization of that end above all<br/>
					of the godly life,<br/>
					for the sake of which<br/>
					clansmen rightly go forth<br/>
					from the home to the homeless life;<br/>
					and he knew:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Birth is ended,<br/>
					the godly life lived,<br/>
					done is what was to be done,<br/>

					and declare gnosis<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#318_n8" id="fn8">8</a>]</sup></span> near him!&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">And he went to the Exalted One,<br/>
					saluted him, and sat down at one side;<br/>
					and so seated, he said:</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="#327_p1" id="p1">1</a>]</span> Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near <a href="#10_savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Now<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#326_n2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span> at that time<br/>
					the venerable Phagguna was sick,<br/>
					ailing,<br/>
					very ill;<br/>
					and the venerable Ānanda<br/>
					went to the Exalted One,<br/>
					saluted,<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated,<br/>
					he said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Lord, the venerable Phagguna is sick,<br/>
					ailing,<br/>
					very ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Good were it, lord,<br/>
					if the Exalted One<br/>
					were to go and see the venerable Phagguna<br/>
					out of compassion.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One consented by silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then in the evening,<br/>
					after he had come from solitude,<br/>
					the Exalted One visited the venerable Phagguna.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Phagguna saw him coming,<br/>
					when he was some way off,<br/>
					and stirred<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#326_n3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span> on his bed;<br/>
					but the Exalted One spoke to him and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Enough, Phagguna!</p>

					<p class="f4">Stir not on your bed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Are there not these seats<br/>
					here prepared already?</p>

					<p class="f4">I will sit here.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">And he sat down<br/>
					on the seat prepared.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated,<br/>
					the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;I hope, Phagguna, you&apos;re bearing up,<br/>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Lord, I can neither bear up<br/>

					<p class="f4">Lord,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#326_n5" id="fn5">5</a>]</sup></span> the violent ache<br/>

					my pains grow more,<br/>

					and there are signs of their growing more,<br/>
					not less.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, the violent pain in my head<br/>
					is just as though some lusty fellow<br/>
					clapped a stout leather strap about it;<br/>
					lord, I cannot bear up<br/>
					nor keep going;<br/>
					my pains grow more,<br/>
					not less;<br/>
					and there are signs of their growing more,<br/>
					not less.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, the violent stab<br/>
					that shoots through my stomach<br/>
					is just as though a skilful butcher<br/>
					or his apprentice<br/>
					gutted it with a carving knife;<br/>
					lord, I cannot bear up<br/>
					nor keep going;<br/>
					my pains grow more,<br/>
					not less;<br/>
					and there are signs of their growing more,<br/>
					not less.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, the fever of my body<br/>
					is just as though a couple of lusty fellows<br/>
					had seized a weakling by his limbs<br/>
					and toasted him<br/>
					and roasted him<br/>
					over a fire-pit;<br/>
					lord, I cannot bear bear up<br/>
					nor keep going;<br/>
					my pains grow more,<br/>
					not less;<br/>
					and there are signs of their growing more,<br/>

					<p class="f4">So the Exalted One instructed him,<br/>
					roused him,<br/>
					gladdened him<br/>
					and comforted him<br/>
					with Dhamma-talk,<br/>
					then rose from his seat<br/>
					and departed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now not long after the Exalted One&apos;s departure,<br/>
					the venerable Phagguna died;<br/>
					and at the time of his death<br/>
					his faculties were completely purified.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then went the venerable Ānanda<br/>
					to the Exalted One,<br/>
					saluted him,<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Lord, not long after the Exalted One left,<br/>
					the venerable Phagguna died;<br/>
					and at that time<br/>
					his faculties were completely purified.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;But why, Ānanda,<br/>

							<p>Thug. It would probably be better not to use &apos;thug&apos; in this case as the term originated in India, and much later,  and specifically designated a religious cult of Kali-worshiping Mohamadin thieves that always strangled their victims.<br/>

And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine, Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow: And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up. And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth: But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away. And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit. And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth ... And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable. And he said unto them ... The sower soweth the word. And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts. And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness; And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word&apos;s sake, immediately they are offended. And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word, And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful. And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit ...</span><br/>

							<p>Consult <i>Points of Controversy</i> if you must, but be warned that it is an exercise in four-dimensional insanity. The Theravadan position is argued ineptly with flawed understanding, the opposing position is sometimes correct and sometimes not, the commentary is, as translated, confused and contradictory, and the translator&apos;s bias and lack of knowledge based on experience renders the whole of it suspect.<br/>
							The issue is: Does the one who has <i>Diṭṭhisampadā-,</i> (achieved view, or who &apos;knows and sees&apos;, that is, one who sees the truth of the Four Truths), that is the Streamwinner, have exactly seven more births, or can such a one have fewer than seven more births; and does such a one still experience thirst for the sensations that would result from deeds that would lead to rebirths lower than the human state. The first proposition is answered by the fact that even the Arahant is considered a Streamwinner, so the idea is &apos;seven rebirths at most&apos; but fewer if there is exertion that results in deeper insights. The second proposition is answered by understanding the difference between experience of sensations, possibly even temptations, that arise from a passing thought, and the performance of an act. The Streamwinner in the earlier stages, may still experience thoughts that if acted on would lead to a bad rebirth, but because he has seen the truth of High View, that knowledge would rise up before him and he would see the danger and abstain from the act prior to actually taking any step that would lead to such bad rebirth.<br/>
							The Pali in this sutta makes the distinction clear. The term is <i>apāyagamaniyaɱ (rāgaɱ, dosaɱ, mohaɱ)</i>. &apos;suchas would lead to the <i>apāya</i>.&apos; His lust, hate, or delusion does not rise to the level of taking action even to the degree of resolute &apos;wishing.&apos; The nature of high view, when it is seen as it is, is of such an extent as to be said to be ever-present. In the idea &apos;<i>This</i> is Pain&apos;, the <i>This</i> is everything whatsoever that can be said to exist and so comes up in relation to everything.</p>
