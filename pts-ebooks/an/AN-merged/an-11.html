<meta content="The F.L. Woodward translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Elevens, Sutta 1. Ānanda asks about the point and the profit, and the Buddha explains that good conduct has freedom from remorse as object and profit; freedom from remorse has joy; joy has rapture; rapture has calm; calm has happiness; happiness has concentration; concentration has seeing things as they really are; seeing things as they really are has revulsion; revulsion has fading interest; and fading of interest has release by knowing and seeing as their object and profit." name="description"/>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a href="#1_fn1" id="n1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Nissāya</i> is the name given to this chapter, from the frequent occurrence of the word in §9. Text wrongly prints <i>nissaya</i> (pupillage), the name of a sutta of the Tens, No. 34.</p>

					<p class="f2">The following footnotes from <a href="#6_p1">AN 10.1</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a href="#1_fn2" id="n2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Kim-atthiyaŋ.</i> It is not easy to translate this, the adjective of <i>attha</i> (<i>cf.</i> <i>G.S.</i> iv, pp. vii, x, xix). The root-idea is &apos;thing-sought,&apos; or &apos;-needed,&apos; and so &apos;aimed at.&apos; This is well shown in the much-used parable of the man <i>sār-atthiko (-ika=iya),</i> &apos;seeking (or needing) timber&apos;: see below again, p. 201 [here]; also five times in the <i>Majjhima</i> and four times in <i>K.S.</i> The &apos;forward view&apos; in the contexts makes such a term as &apos;of what use&apos; not quite so suitable.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a href="#1_fn3" id="n3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Sīlāni</i> (good conduct) is more literally habits, then, moral habits. The English words have too wide and deep a range.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a href="#1_fn4" id="n4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Avippaṭisāro;</i> cf. <a href="#10_pg73"><i>D.</i> i, 73;</a> <a href="#11_pg351"><i>S.</i> iv, 351;</a> <a href="#12_"><i>A.</i> iii, 21</a> = <a href="#13_pg16"><i>G.S.</i> iii, 16.</a> In the Elevens the same set is made into eleven by taking revulsion-and-fading as two terms.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a href="#1_fn5" id="n5">5</a>]</sup> <i>Samādhi.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a href="#1_fn6" id="n6">6</a>]</sup> <i>Anupubbena aggāya parenti; cf.</i> <a href="#14_pg20"><i>S.</i> ii. 20,</a> <i>ucchedaŋ pareti;</i> <a href="#15_pg139">below, pp. 139,</a> <a href="#8_pg312">312 of text</a> (<i>hānāya</i>).

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, Mahānāma,<br/>

					as being unbroken, whole, unspotted,<br/>
					untarnished, giving freedom,<br/>
					as praised by the discerning ones,<br/>

					which lead to concentration of the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">At such time, Mahānāma,<br/>

					at that time<br/>
					his heart is not obsessed by lust, malice and delusion.<br/>
					At such a time his heart is upright,<br/>

					<p class="f4">In one joyous is born zest;<br/>
					in one of zestful mind<br/>

					<p class="f4">This recollection of the virtues, Mahānāma,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, Mahānāma,<br/>
					you should recollect your own liberality, thus:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">&apos;A gain, indeed, it is to me,<br/>
					well gained it is by me<br/>
					that, amid folk o&apos;ergrown with the blight of stinginess,<br/>

					open-handed, pure-handed,<br/>

					<p class="f4">At such time, Mahānāma,<br/>

					at that time<br/>
					his heart is not obsessed by lust, malice and delusion.<br/>
					His heart is upright,<br/>
					is firmly fixed on liberality;<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, Mahānāma, you should recollect the devas, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;There are the devas of the Four Great Kings,<br/>

					the devas of Yama,<br/>
					the devas of delight,<br/>

					those who have power over the creations of others,<br/>
					the devas of the body of Brahmā,<br/>
					the devas beyond that.</p>

					<p class="f4">In me too is seen<br/>

					<p class="f4">In me too is seen<br/>

					<p class="f4">At such time, Mahānāma,<br/>

					At that time<br/>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="#110_p1" id="p1">1</a>]</span> On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying among the Sakyans<br/>
					at Kapilavatthu in Banyan Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that <a id="109_pg214"><span class="f2 g"><b>[214]</b></span></a> occasion<br/>
					the Exalted One was desirous<br/>
					of taking up residence<br/>
					during the rainy season<br/>
					at Sāvatthī.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And Nandiya the Sakyan heard it said<br/>
					that the Exalted One so desired.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a href="#107_pg335" id="pt335"><span class="f2">[335]</span></a> Then it occurred to him:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">&quot;Suppose I also were to take up residence<br/>
					at Sāvatthī during the rainy season.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then I could both apply myself<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#109_n2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span> to my business<br/>
					and at the same time<br/>
					get a chance of seeing the Exalted One<br/>
					from time to time.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">So the Exalted One took up residence at Sāvatthī<br/>
					during the rainy season<br/>
					and Nandiya the Sakyan did the same.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There he applied himself to his business<br/>
					and from time to time<br/>
					got a chance of seeing the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time<br/>
					a number of monks were busy<br/>
					making robes for the Exalted One:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">&quot;For,&quot; said they, &quot;when the rains are over<br/>
					the Exalted One will go forth on his rounds.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">And Nandiya the Sakyan heard it said<br/>
					that a number of monks were busy<br/>
					making robes for the Exalted One,<br/>
					and that when the rains were over<br/>
					the Exalted One would set forth on his rounds,<br/>
					so he went to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					saluted the Exalted One<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So seated he said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;I have heard it said, sir,<br/>
					that a number of monks are busy<br/>
					making robes for the Exalted One,<br/>
					and that when the rains are over<br/>
					the Exalted One will set forth on his rounds.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, sir, among those who live in various ways,<br/>
					in whose way of living should we live?&quot;</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Well asked, Nandiya!<br/>
					Well asked, Nandiya!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is a fit thing for you clansmen<br/>
					to come to see the Wayfarer<br/>
					and ask such a question.</p>

					<p class="f4">He who means business, Nandiya,<br/>
					is a believer, not an unbeliever.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He who means business is virtuous, not immora1.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#109_n3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He who means business<br/>
					is of ardent energy, no sluggard.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He who means business<br/>
					has mindfulness fixed, not distracted.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He who means business<br/>
					is composed, not discomposed.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He who means business<br/>
					is strong in insight, not weak in insight.</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4">When you have established yourself<br/>
					in these six qualities, Nandiya,<br/>
					you should set up mindfulness<br/>
					in the inner self<br/>
					in five<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#109_n4" id="fn4">4</a>]</sup></span> qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Nandiya, you should recollect the Wayfarer thus: <a href="#107_pg336" id="pt336"><span class="f2">[336]</span></a></p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;The Exalted One is an arahant,<br/>
					fully enlightened,<br/>
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/>
					a Welfarer, a world-knower,<br/>
					an unsurpassed trainer of men to be trained,<br/>
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br/>
					an awakened one,<br/>
					Exalted One is he.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Nandiya, firmly fixed on the Wayfarer<br/>
					you should set up mindfulness<br/>
					in the inner self.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, Nandiya, you should recollect Dhamma thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Well <a id="109_pg215"><span class="f2 g"><b>[215]</b></span></a> declared by the Exalted One is Dhamma<br/>
					that is of this visible life,<br/>
					unhindered by time,<br/>
					that bids one come to see it,<br/>
					that leads onward,<br/>
					to be understood by the discerning,<br/>
					each for himself.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Nandiya, firmly fixed on Dhamma<br/>
					you should set up mindfulness<br/>
					in the inner self.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, Nandiya, you should recollect lovely friends thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;A gain to me it is indeed!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well gotten indeed by me it is,<br/>
					that I have lovely friends,<br/>
					compassionate,||<br/>
					desirous of my welfare,<br/>
					who encourage and exhort me.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Nandiya, firmly fixed on lovely friends<br/>
					you should set up mindfulness<br/>
					in the inner self.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, Nandiya, you should recollect your own liberality thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;A gain it is to me indeed!<br/>
					Well gotten indeed it is by me,<br/>
					that amid folk overgrown<br/>
					with the blight of stinginess<br/>
					I live at home cleansed<br/>
					of the blight of stinginess,<br/>
					openhanded, pure-handed,<br/>
					delighting in self-surrender,<br/>
					one to ask a favour of,<br/>
					rejoicing in dispensing charitable gifts.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Nandiya, firmly fixed on liberality<br/>
					you should set up mindfulness<br/>
					in the inner self.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Once more, Nandiya, you should recollect the devas thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Whatsoever devas,<br/>
					passing beyond the company of those devas<br/>
					who subsist on food material,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#109_n5" id="fn5">5</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					do rise up again in a certain mind-made body<br/>
					— such devas observe in the self<br/>
					nothing more to do,<br/>
					no need for repeating what is done.&apos;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#109_n6" id="fn6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Just as, Nandiya,<br/>
					a monk who is definitely released<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#109_n7" id="fn7">7</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					observes in the self no more to do,<br/>
					observes no need for repeating <a id="109_pg216"><span class="f2 g"><b>[216]</b></span></a> what is done,<br/>
					even so, Nandiya,<br/>
					whatsoever devas,<br/>
					passing beyond the company of those devas<br/>
					who subsist on food material,<br/>
					do rise up again in a certain mind-made body,<br/>
					— such devas observe in the self<br/>
					nothing more to do,<br/>
					no need for repeating what is done.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Nandiya, fixed upon the devas<br/>
					you should cause mindfulness to arise<br/>
					in the inner self.</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4">So, Nandiya,<br/>
					possessing these eleven qualities<br/>
					the Ariyan disciple<br/>
					just abandons evil, unprofitable states,<br/>
					he clings not to them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as, Nandiya,<br/>
					a pot upset<br/>
					pours out its water<br/>
					and cannot take it in again;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#109_n8" id="fn8">8</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					or just as fire<br/>
					let loose in a dry grass-jungle<br/>
					goes blazing on<br/>
					and turns not back to what is burnt out,<br/>
					even so, Nandiya,<br/>
					the Ariyan disciple<br/>
					possessed of these eleven qualities<br/>
					just abandons evil, unprofitable states<br/>
					and clings not to them.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">He is the son of a believing disciple<br/>

					<p class="f4">&quot;But, Subhūti, does this believing monk,<br/>
