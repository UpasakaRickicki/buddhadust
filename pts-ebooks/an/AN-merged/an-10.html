					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī<br/>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda came to see the Exalted One,<br/>

					<p class="f4">&quot;But pray, sir, what is the object,<br/>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Knowing and seeing things as they really are, Ānanda,<br/>

					<p class="f4">&quot;What is the object, sir,<br/>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Revulsion and fading of interest, Ānanda,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Pray, sir, what is the object and profit<br/>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Release by knowing and seeing, Ānanda,<br/>
					is the object and profit of these.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">So you see, Ānanda,<br/>
					good conduct has freedom from remorse<br/>

					freedom from remorse has joy;<br/>

					rapture has calm;<br/>

					not too hot or too cold,<br/>
					but even<br/>
					and suitable for striving;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#66_n4" id="fn4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">he is honest,<br/>

					is not too far<br/>
					and not too near (a village),<br/>
					but suitable for coming and going,<br/>

					not plagued with contact of flies,<br/>
					mosquitoes,<br/>
					wind,<br/>
					rain<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, for one dwelling in such a lodging-place<br/>
					the supply of robes and alms-food,<br/>
					of bed and lodging,<br/>
					comforts in sickness<br/>
					and medicaments<br/>
					comes about with little trouble;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">further in that lodging-place<br/>

					<a href="#67_pg16" id="pt16"><span class="f2">[16]</span></a> who know the discipline and summaries by heart.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#66_n7" id="fn7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now it occurred to those monks thus:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">&quot;It is full early yet to range Sāvatthī for alms-food.<br/>

					<p class="f4">Accordingly they did so,<br/>

					<p class="f4">So seated those Wanderers of other views said this to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Your reverences, Gotama the recluse thus teaches dhamma:</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, your reverences,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Herein, your reverences,<br/>

The answer implies that the issue is the care of the novice. The wording here has been reworked to fit a separate question and answer and with the idea that the question is the qualifications of the bhikkhu to have an attendent. See: Bhk. Bodhi where he has this as &quot;...possess to be attended upon by a novice?&quot; and &quot;...may be attended upon by a novice.&quot; <i>bhikkhunā sāmaṇero upaṭṭhāpetabbo</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near <a href="#64_savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Yes, lord,&quot; they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Monks, there are these ten disadvantages of entering the royal court.</p>

					<p class="f4">What ten?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this connexion, monks,<br/>
					suppose the rāgā is seated with his favourite wife.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then in comes a monk.</p>

					<p class="f4">The wife, on seeing the monk,<br/>
					smiles,<br/>
					or else the monk smiles<br/>
					on seeing her.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the rāgā thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Surely these two are guilty<br/>
					or will be guilty.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the first disadvantage of entering the royal court.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, suppose the rāgā,<br/>
					his mind being much occupied with business,<br/>
					has intercourse with a certain woman and for- <a id="290_pg58"><span class="f2 g"><b>[58]</b></span></a> gets about it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereby she becomes pregnant.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the rāgā thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;No one but a home-leaver<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#290_n1" id="fn1">1</a>]</sup></span> enters here.</p>

					<p class="f4">Maybe it is the work of a home-leaver.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the second disadvantage of entering the royal court.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, perhaps some gem is missing in the royal court.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the rāgā thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;No one but a home-leaver enters here.</p>

					<p class="f4">Maybe it is the work of a home-leaver.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the third disadvantage of entering the royal court.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, the secret plans<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#290_n2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span> within the royal court,<br/>
					by being divulged abroad,<br/>
					are spoiled.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the rāgā thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;No one but a home-leaver enters here.</p>

					<p class="f4">Maybe it is the work of a home-leaver.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fourth disadvantage of entering the royal court.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, in the royal court<br/>
					a father aspires for a son<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#290_n3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					or a son aspires for a father.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then they think:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;No one but a home-leaver enters here.</p>

					<p class="f4">It must be the work of a home-leaver.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fifth disadvantage of entering the royal court.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, monks, a rāgā sets up a man of low estate<br/>
					in a high place.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those to whom this is displeasing think thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;The rajā is intimate with the home-leaver.</p>

					<p class="f4">This must be the work of the home-leaver.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the sixth disadvantage of entering the royal court.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, the rāgā puts a man of high estate<br/>
					in a low place.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those to whom this is displeasing think think thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;The rajā is intimate with the home-leaver.</p>

					<p class="f4">This must be the work of the home-leaver.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the seventh disadvantage of entering the royal court.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, the rāgā musters the host unseasonably.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those to whom this is displeasing think thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;The rāgā is intimate with the home-leaver.</p>

					<p class="f4">This must be the work of the home-leaver.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the eighth disadvantage of entering the royal court.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, the rāgā,<br/>
					after mustering the host at the proper time,<br/>
					<a id="290_pg59"><span class="f2 g"><b>[59]</b></span></a> sends it back from the highroad.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those to whom this is displeasing think thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;The rāgā is intimate with the home-leaver.</p>

					<p class="f4">This must be the work of the home-leaver.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the ninth disadvantage of entering the royal court.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Once more, monks,<br/>
					the rāgā&apos;s court is crowded<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#290_n4" id="fn4">4</a>]</sup></span> with elephants, horses and chariots;<br/>
					objects,<br/>
					sounds,<br/>
					scents<br/>
					and savours<br/>

					have to be encountered,<br/>
					such as are not suited to one<br/>
					who has given up (the world).<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#290_n5" id="fn5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the tenth disadvantage of entering the rāgā&apos;s court.</p>

					<p class="f4">So, monks, these are the ten disadvantages of entering the rāgā&apos;s court.&apos;</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a href="#290_fn4" id="n4">4</a>]</sup> Text quite unsuitably reads <i>sammada</i> (drowsiness), but with <i>v.l.</i> <i>sammadda:</i> so also <i>Comy.</i>, which explains as equal to <i>sambādha.</i> <i>Cf.</i> the passage at <a href="#292_"><i>K.S.</i> v, 303 <i>ff.,</i></a> where the chamberlains Isidatta and Purāṇa complain of the difficulties of official life at court.</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Yes, lord,&quot; they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Monks, were not three states found existing in the world,<br/>
					the Wayfarer would not arise in the world,<br/>
					an arahant rightly enlightened;<br/>

					<p class="f4">What are the three states?</p>

					<p class="f4">Birth, decay and death.</p>

					<p class="f4">Were not these three states found existing in the world, the Wayfarer would not arise in the world,<br/>

He had abused the great disciples in a former birth. <i>DhpA.</i> on <a href="#129_v363"><i>Dhp.</i> v. 363</a> describes these gāthās as referring to him. He was a native of the town Kokālī</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near <a href="#64_savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br/>
					at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika&apos;s Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the housefather <a href="#534_">Anāthapiṇḍika</a> left Sāvatthī at an early hour<br/>
					to visit the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">But it occurred to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;It is not time to see the Exalted One,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Nor is it time to see the monks<br/>
					who make the mind to grow;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#543_n1" id="fn1">1</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					those monks are in retirement.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose I were to pay a visit<br/>
					to the Park where dwell<br/>
					the Wanderers who hold other views?&quot;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">So the housefather Anathapiṇḍika drew near<br/>
					the Park where dwelt<br/>
					the Wanderers holding other views.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion<br/>
					the Wanderers holding other views,<br/>
					having come together in a great company,<br/>
					were sitting engaged in divers childish talk,<br/>
					all talking loudly,<br/>
					making a great noise and din.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when they saw the housefather Anāthapiṇḍika approaching,<br/>
					while yet he was at some distance,<br/>
					they hushed each other, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Make little noise, your reverence!</p>

					<p class="f4">Make no noise, your reverence!</p>

					<p class="f4">Here comes the housefather Anāthapiṇḍika,<br/>
					a disciple of Gotama the recluse.</p>

					<p class="f4">This housefather Anāthapiṇḍika<br/>
					is one of those disciples of Gotama the recluse,<br/>
					householders clad in white,<br/>
					who live at Sāvatthi.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now those worthies are fond of little noise,<br/>
					they are schooled to little noise,<br/>
					they speak in praise of little noise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Maybe, if he sees our company making little noise,<br/>
					he will think it worth his while to draw near.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">So those Wanderers kept silence.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">So the housefather Anāthapiṇḍika drew near to those Wanderers,<br/>

					<p class="f4">&quot;This, sirs, indeed were no hard task -<br/>

					<p class="f4">But first let your reverences<br/>

					<p class="f4">Nor is it time to see the monks<br/>

					<p class="f4">Suppose I were to pay a visit<br/>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Make little noise, your reverence!</p>

					<p class="f4">Make no noise, your reverence!</p>

					<p class="f4">Here comes the housefather Vajjiyamāhita,<br/>

					<p class="f4">This housefather Vajjiyamāhita<br/>

					<p class="f4">&quot;If then with full comprehension<br/>

					or only half of it<br/>
					or one third part of it?&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words the Exalted One was silent.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="553_pg134"><span class="f2 g"><b>[134]</b></span></a> Then it occurred to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;The Wanderer Uttiya must not be allowed to entertain the harmful view<br/>
					that:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">&apos;Gotama the recluse,<br/>
					when asked by him an all-important question,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#553_n5" id="fn5">5</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					let it drop.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Can it be that he cannot answer it?&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a view would be loss and sorrow<br/>
					for a long time<br/>
					to the Wanderer Uttiya.&quot;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">So the venerable Ānanda said this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;See now, Uttiya, your reverence,<br/>
					I will make a figure for you.</p>

					<p class="f4">In a figure sometimes intelligent people understand the meaning of what is said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose a border-town of some rājah,<br/>
					with strong foundations,<br/>
					strong walls and towers,<br/>
					but a single gate;<br/>
					and over that gate is set a warden,<br/>
					shrewd and watchful,<br/>
					who keeps out strangers<br/>
					and lets in known people.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he patrols all round that town in due order<br/>
					he might not mark a crevice in the wall<br/>
					or a hole big enough for a cat to slip through,<br/>
					nor would he have the knowledge:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;So many creatures enter<br/>
					or so many creatures leave this town.&apos;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#553_n6" id="fn6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">But this he would know:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Whatsoever creatures of any size<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#553_n7" id="fn7">7</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					enter or leave this town,<br/>
					all of them enter or leave by this gate.&apos;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Just in the same way, your reverence<br/>
					(that question of yours, namely):</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Will the whole world escape thereby<br/>
					or half of it<br/>
					or one third part of it?&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">is not a matter of urgent importance to the Wayfarer.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">What he says is this:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Whosoever have escaped,<br/>
					are escaping<br/>
					or will escape from the world,<br/>
					all of them,<br/>
					by abandoning the five hindrances,<br/>
					those defilements of the heart<br/>
					which cause the weakening of insight -<br/>
					all of them<br/>
					with thoughts well established in the four arisings of mindfulness,<br/>
					by making to grow in very truth the seven limbs of wisdom -<br/>
					all of them have escaped,<br/>
					are escaping<br/>
					or will escape by so doing.&apos;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">So as to that question of yours which <a id="553_pg135"><span class="f2 g"><b>[135]</b></span></a> you put to the Exalted One,<br/>
					you asked it from a different point of view.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#553_n8" id="fn8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">That is why the Exalted One did not explain the matter to you.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near <a href="#64_savatthi">Sāvatthī</a>,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika&apos;s Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Upāli came to see the Exalted One<br/>
					and on coming to him saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side<br/>
					seated <a href="#574_pg202" id="pt202"><span class="f2">[202]</span></a> at one side he said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Sir, I desire to frequent woodland haunts in the forest,<br/>
					to be a lodger in solitude.&quot;</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Upāli, to frequent woodland haunts in the forest<br/>
					and to be a lodger in solitude<br/>
					are things hard to compass.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#451_n1" id="fn1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">A hard thing it is to dwell secluded;<br/>
					it is hard to find delight in living alone;<br/>
					the woods strain the mind,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#451_n2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span> methinks,<br/>
					of a monk who has not won concentration of mind.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoso, Upāli, should say:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Though I have not won concentration of mind,<br/>
					yet I will frequent woodland haunts in the forest,<br/>
					I will be a lodger in solitude,&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">of him it is to be expected<br/>
					that either he will sink to the bottom<br/>
					or float on the surface.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#451_n3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, Upāli, a great pool of water.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then comes a bull elephant<br/>
					seven<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#451_n4" id="fn4">4</a>]</sup></span> or eight cubits<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#451_n5" id="fn5">5</a>]</sup></span> in height.</p>

					<p class="f4">He thinks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Suppose I plunge into this pool of water<br/>
					and amuse myself with the sport<br/>
					of squirting water into my ears<br/>
					or over my back.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I have enjoyed this sport<br/>
					and washed<br/>
					and drunk<br/>
					and come out again,<br/>
					suppose I go whithersoever it pleases me.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">So in he goes and does so,<br/>
					comes out again<br/>
					and goes whithersoever it pleases him.</p>

					<p class="f4">How can he do it?</p>

					<p class="f4">The great bulk of his person, Upāli,<br/>
					finds a footing in deep water.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><a href="#574_pg203" id="pt203"><span class="f2">[203]</span></a> But suppose a hare<br/>
					or a cat<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#451_n6" id="fn6">6</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					should come and say to itself:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;What difference is there between myself<br/>
					and a bull elephant?</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose I plunge into this pool of water<br/>
					and amuse myself with the sport<br/>
					of squirting water into my ears<br/>
					or over my back?</p>

					<p class="f4">When I have enjoyed this sport<br/>
					and washed<br/>
					and drunk<br/>
					and come out again,<br/>
					suppose I go whithersoever it pleases me?&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="451_pg141"><span class="f2 g"><b>[141]</b></span></a> So he springs into that pool of water hastily<br/>
					and without consideration.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then this is to be expected of him:<br/>
					either he will sink to the bottom<br/>
					or float on the surface.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">The smallness of his person, Upāli,<br/>
					finds no footing in deep water.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Just in the same way, Upāli,<br/>
					whoso should say:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Though I have not won concentration of mind,<br/>
					yet I will frequent woodland haunts in the forest,<br/>
					I will be a lodger in solitude&apos; -</p>

					<p class="f4">of him it is to be expected<br/>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4">Again, Upāli,<br/>
					suppose a tender boy-child,<br/>
					feeble<br/>
					and lying on his back<br/>
					and playing with his own excrements.</p>

					<p class="f4">What think you, Upāli?</p>

					<p class="f4">Does not this childish sport<br/>
					come to completion and fullness?&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">It does, sir.</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Well then, Upāli,<br/>
					that boy-child<br/>
					on another occasion,<br/>
					when he has grown older,<br/>
					following on the ripening of the sense-faculties,<br/>
					plays with whatever may be the playthings of such children,<br/>
					such as a toy-plough,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#451_n7" id="fn7">7</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					tip-cat,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#451_n8" id="fn8">8</a>]</sup></span><br/>

					leaf-pannikins,<br/>
					toy-carts<br/>
					and toy-bows.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think you, Upāli?</p>

					<p class="f4">Does not this game<br/>
					come to be finer<br/>
					and more valued<br/>
					than the former?</p>

					<p class="f4">It does, sir.</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Well, Upāli,<br/>
					that child later on,<br/>
					when he has grown older<br/>
					owing to the ripening of his sense-faculties,<br/>
					and has come into possession<br/>
					of the five sense-pleasures<br/>
					and is possessed by them,<br/>
					he becomes a prey to them,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Now what <a id="451_pg142"><span class="f2 g"><b>[142]</b></span></a> think you, Upāli?</p>

					<p class="f4">Does not this game<br/>

					<p class="f4">A Wayfarer arises in the world,<br/>

					a Wellfarer,<br/>
					world-knower,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a housefather<br/>
					or housefather&apos;s son<br/>
					or one reborn in some family or other<br/>
					hears that dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">On hearing that dhamma<br/>
					he wins faith in the Wayfarer.</p>

					<p class="f4">In possession of that faith<br/>
					which he has won<br/>
					he ponders thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Oppressive is the home-life,<br/>

					<p class="f4">The way of going forth<br/>

					<p class="f4">It is no easy thing<br/>

					in all its completeness,<br/>
					in utter purity<br/>
					like a polished shell.</p>

					<p class="f4">How if I were to get the hair of my beard shorn and,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He, having thus gone forth,<br/>

Bodhi words this understanding: &apos;But they still haven&apos;t attained their own goal.&apos;) because it is often an admonition given to bhikkhus to not give up at a point where self-deception could easily lead to the thought that one has accomplished the goal. But both ideas would miss the point being made here which is to give Upāli an indication of the difficulty of attaining the goal and by that the difficulty of successful forest living. Woodward&apos;s idea that one was to give up solitary living once the goal was attained was one which was popular at one time, but which has very little basis in the suttas. Forest living, solitary living is highly praised by Gotama right up to the end as being a great inspiration for those who follow. In other words, forest living <i>is</i> teaching.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a href="#631_edfn1" id="edn1">ed1</a>]</sup> The whole of this section, down to &quot;Well done, monks!&quot; is abbreviated by Woodward as follows:<br/>
					<i>(and they repeated their thoughts of a visit to Ānanda) ... So, sir, we went to see the venerable Ānanda and asked him the meaning of this. Then to us here the meaning of it was well detailed with these reasons, in these words, in these particulars by the venerable Ānanda.&apos;</i><br/>
					The detailed meaning, but not the introductory matter, is abbreviated in a similar way in the Pali, not with the more usual &quot;...pe...&quot; .</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a href="#631_edfn2" id="edn2">ed2</a>]</sup> At this point Woodward, following the Pali, abbreviates by omitting the final repetition completely, but we have many cases where the usual habit is as here in this version. The idea is rehersal to insure accurate memory. The commentary cited by Woodward above would have the initial exposition in brief be a simple excuse by Gotama to hear his own praises. This is unworthy of the commentator, not to mention Gotama, and more likely is the knowledge from previous experience, that Ānanda or some other Bhikkhu of experience would be sought out by the bhikkhus and that the teaching would by that become further developed and memorialized. We can see from the previous few suttas that this is an evolving sutta and the development here is one we have seen prevously for other suttas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rising up thrice in that night,<br/>

					though he saw, he says &apos;I saw not&apos;.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus for his own sake<br/>
					or that of others<br/>
					or to get some carnal profit or other<br/>
					he deliberately utters falsehood.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Also he is a slanderer.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing something at one place<br/>
					he proclaims it somewhere else<br/>
					to bring about a quarrel between the parties;<br/>
					what he has heard here<br/>
					he repeats there<br/>
					to bring about a quarrel between the parties.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he breaks up harmony,<br/>
					foments strife between those discordant,<br/>
					discord is his delight;<br/>
					exulting in<br/>
					and passionately fond of discord,<br/>
					he utters speech<br/>
					that makes for discord.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Also he is of harsh speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever speech is rough,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#749_n8" id="fn8">8</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					cutting,<br/>
					bitter about others,<br/>
					abusive of others,<br/>
					provoking wrath<br/>
					and conducive to distraction -<br/>
					such speech does he utter.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He is given to idle babble,<br/>
					he speaks out of season,<br/>
					speaks unrealities;<br/>
					he speaks things unprofitable,<br/>
					what is not-dhamma<br/>
					and not-discipline;<br/>
					he utters speech not worth treasuring up,<br/>
					speech unreasonable<br/>
					and not worth listening to,<br/>
					undiscriminating<br/>
					and unconcerned with profit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Cunda, defilement by speech is fourfold.</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4">And how is defilement by mind threefold?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Cunda, a certain one is covetous,<br/>
					he is one who covets <a id="749_pg178"><span class="f2 g"><b>[178]</b></span></a> the property of another,<br/>
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">O that what is another&apos;s were mine!</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He is malevolent of heart,<br/>
					the thoughts of his heart are corrupt, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Let these beings be slain,<br/>
					come to destruction,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#749_n9" id="fn9">9</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					be destroyed,<br/>
					not exist at all.&apos;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Also he has wrong view,<br/>
					he is perverse in outlook,<br/>
					holding:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;There is no gift,<br/>
					no offering,<br/>
					no sacrifice;<br/>
					there is no fruit or ripening of deeds<br/>
					well done or ill done;<br/>
					this world is not,<br/>
					the world beyond is not;<br/>
					there is no mother,<br/>
					no father,<br/>
					no beings supernaturally born;<br/>
					there are no recluses and brāhmins in the world<br/>
					who have gone right,<br/>
					who fare rightly,<br/>
					men who by their own comprehension<br/>
					have realized this world<br/>
					and the world beyond<br/>
					and thus declare.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Cunda, defilement by mind is threefold.</p>

					<p class="f4">Cunda, there are those ten ways of wrong action.</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4">One characterized by those ten ways of wrong action<br/>
					may rise up early<br/>
					and at eventide<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#749_edn1" id="edfn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span> touch the earth,<br/>
					yet is he still impure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even if he touch not the earth<br/>
					he is equally impure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Though he handle cowdung he is impure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even if he does not handle cowdung<br/>
					he is equally impure.</p>

					<p class="f4">He may handle green grasses or not</p>

					<p class="f4">He may worship the fire or not</p>

					<p class="f4">He may clasp his hands<br/>
					and bow to the sun or not,<br/>
					he is impure just the same.</p>

					<p class="f4">He may descend in the evening into water for the third time<br/>
					or not,<br/>
					yet is he still impure.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the cause of that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Those ten ways of wrong action, Cunda,<br/>
					are impure<br/>
					and cause impurity.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, as a result of being characterized<br/>
					by those ten ways of wrong action,<br/>
					purgatory is declared,<br/>
					birth in the womb of animals is declared,<br/>
					the realm of ghosts is declared,<br/>
					either that or some other form of ill-bourn.</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4">But, Cunda, threefold is cleansing by body,<br/>
					fourfold is cleansing by speech,<br/>
					threefold is cleansing by mind.</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4">And how is cleansing by body threefold?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Cunda, a certain one abandons taking life,<br/>
					abstains therefrom;<br/>
					he has laid aside the rod,<br/>
					has laid aside the knife;<br/>
					he dwells modest,<br/>
					charitable,<br/>
					feeling compassion towards every living creature.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He abandons taking what is not given,<br/>
					abstains therefrom;<br/>
					<a id="749_pg179"><span class="f2 g"><b>[179]</b></span></a> the property of another,<br/>
					situated in jungle or in village,<br/>
					if not given,<br/>
					he takes not with thievish intent.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">In sexual desires<br/>
					he abandons wrong action,<br/>
					abstains therefrom.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He has no intercourse<br/>
					with girls in ward of mother or father,<br/>
					of brother,<br/>
					sister<br/>
					or relatives (or clan),<br/>
					with girls lawfully guarded,<br/>
					already plighted to a husband<br/>
					and protected by the rod,<br/>
					even with girls crowned<br/>
					with the flower-garlands (of betrothal).</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Cunda, threefold is cleansing by body.</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4">And how is cleansing by speech fourfold?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#749_edn2" id="edfn2">ed2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Cunda, a certain one abandons lying speech<br/>
					he abstains therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">When cited to appear before the council<br/>
					or a company<br/>
					or amid his relatives<br/>
					or guild-men<br/>
					or before the royal family<br/>
					and asked to bear witness<br/>
					with the words:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Come, good fellow!<br/>
					Say what you know.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">If he knows not, he says, &apos;I know not&apos;;<br/>
					if he knows, he says, &apos;I know&apos;;<br/>
					if he has not seen, he says &apos;I saw not&apos;;<br/>
					if he saw, he says &apos;I saw&apos;.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus neither for his own sake<br/>
					or that of others<br/>
					or to get some carnal profit or other<br/>
					does he deliberately utter falsehood.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning slanderous speech<br/>
					he abstains therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he hears something at one place<br/>
					he does not proclaim it elsewhere<br/>
					to bring about a quarrel between the parties;<br/>
					what he has heard here<br/>
					he does not report there<br/>
					to bring about a quarrel between the parties;<br/>
					thus he brings together the discordant,<br/>
					restores harmony,<br/>
					harmony is his delight,<br/>
					he exults in,<br/>
					is passionately fond of harmony;<br/>
					he utters speech that makes for harmony.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Also he abandons harsh speech,<br/>
					abstains therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever speech is blameless,<br/>
					pleasant to the ear,<br/>
					affectionate,<br/>
					going to the heart,<br/>
					urbane,<br/>
					agreeable to many folk,<br/>
					delightful to many folk,<br/>
					of such speech he is a speaker.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Also abandoning idle babble<br/>
					he abstains therefrom;<br/>
					he speaks in season,<br/>
					of facts,<br/>
					of the aim,<br/>
					of dhamma,<br/>
					of discipline;<br/>
					he utters speech worth treasuring up,<br/>
					speech seasonable<br/>
					and worth listening to,<br/>
					discriminating<br/>
					and concerned with the aim.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Cunda, fourfold is cleansing by speech.</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4">And how is cleansing by mind threefold?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a certain one is not covetous;<br/>
					he covets not the property of another,<br/>
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">0 that what is another&apos;s were mine!</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He is not malevolent of heart,<br/>
					the thoughts of his heart<br/>
					are not corrupt.</p>

					<p class="f4">He wishes:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Let these beings carry about the self<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#749_n10" id="fn10">10</a>]</sup></span> in peace,<br/>
					free from enmity,<br/>
					free from sorrow<br/>
					and in happiness.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Also he has right view;<br/>
					he is reasonable in outlook,<br/>
					holding that there are such things as gift,<br/>
					offering,<br/>
					oblation,<br/>
					fruit and ripening of deeds<br/>
					done well or ill;<br/>
					that this world is,<br/>
					<a id="749_pg180"><span class="f2 g"><b>[180]</b></span></a> that the world beyond is;<br/>
					that mother, father and beings of supernatural birth (in other worlds) do exist;<br/>
					that there are in the world recluses and brāhmins<br/>
					who have gone rightly,<br/>
					who fare rightly,<br/>
					men who of their own comprehension<br/>
					have realized this world and the world beyond<br/>
					and thus declare it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Cunda, threefold is the cleansing by the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">So these are the ten ways of right doing.</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4">One characterized by those ten ways<br/>
					may rise up early<br/>
					and at evening<br/>
					touch the earth,<br/>
					yet is he pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he touch not the earth,<br/>
					yet is he pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whether he handle cowdung or not,<br/>
					yet is he pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whether he handle green grasses or not,<br/>
					yet is he pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whether he worship the fire or not,<br/>
					yet is he pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whether he clasp his hands and bow down to the sun or not,<br/>
					yet is he pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whether he descend in the evening into water for the third time or not,<br/>
					yet is he pure for all that.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, Cunda, those ten ways of right action<br/>
					are pure<br/>
					and work purity.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">By being characterized by those ten ways of right action<br/>
					(the state of) devahood is proclaimed,<br/>

							<p>&apos;Purgatory&apos; is Woodward&apos;s suggested translation for <i>Niraye,</i> Hell, in accordance with a precise understanding of the Judeo-Christian concept where &apos;Hell&apos; proper is eternal and Purgatory temporary. Since Niraye is a temporary condition, was the thinking, this could not qualify it to be called Hell. The Buddhist position, is that there is no state of existence which is eternal. The common understanding of the idea of Hell today will do for life in Niraye, which can last to the end of a world cycle, but not forever.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he breaks up harmony,<br/>

					discord is his delight;<br/>
					exulting in<br/>
					and passionately fond of discord,<br/>
					he utters speech<br/>
					that makes for discord.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Also he is of harsh speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever speech is rough,<br/>

					provoking wrath<br/>
					and conducive to distraction -<br/>
					such speech does he utter.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He is given to idle babble,<br/>
					he speaks out of season,<br/>
					speaks unrealities;<br/>
					he speaks things unprofitable,<br/>
					what is not-dhamma<br/>
					and not-discipline;<br/>
					he utters speech not worth treasuring up,<br/>

					<p class="f4">And how is the prosperity of mental action<br/>
