M., <i>arūupajjhānena c&apos;eva ariyamaggena cāti ubhatobhāgena vimutto ti ubhatobhāgavimutto, u.</i> means one who is emancipated in two ways, namely by <i>arūpajjhāna</i> and by <i>ariyamagga.</i> He also quotes from Aŋguttara Nikāya, <i>ubhatobhāgavimutto ti dvīhi bhāgehi vimutto arūpasamāpattiyā rūpakā-yato vimutto maggena nāmakāyato, so catunnaɱ arūpasamāpattīnam ekekato vuṭṭhāya saŋkhāre sammasitvā arahattappattānaɱ catunnan ti nirodhā vuṭṭhāya arahattaɱ pattassa anāgāmino vasena ca pancavidho hoti:</i> of which Vij. sends me this translation, &quot;<i>Ubh.</i> is he who is emancipated in two ways, by means of <i>Arūpasamāpatti</i> he is emancipated from the body of form, by means of the <i>Magga</i> from the body of <i>Nāma.</i> He is of five kinds, namely four who having risen from the <i>Arūpasamāpatti</i> one after another and having grasped the <i>Saŋkhāras</i> attains Arhatship, and the Anāgāmin who having risen from the <i>Nirodha-samāpatti</i> attains arhatship.&quot; From this it appears that the <i>Ubh.</i> may be either an <i>arahatta-phalaṭṭha</i> in one of the four Arūpa havens, or an anāgāmin who has attained <i>arahattaphala</i> through the <i>Nirodha</i> meditation.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="#139_p1" id="p1">1</a>][<a href="#140_p1">than</a>]</span> Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once, when the Exalted One dwelt near <a href="#134_rajagaha">Rājagaha</a> on Mount Vulture Peak,<br/>
					the Magadhan rajah, <a href="#141_">Ajātasattu</a>, the Videhan&apos;s<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#138_n2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span> son,<br/>
					wished to attack the Vajjians.</p>

					<p class="f4">Said he:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Though they are so powerful and strong,<br/>
					I&apos;ll root them out,<br/>
					I&apos;ll destroy them,<br/>
					I&apos;ll reduce these Vajjians to wretchedness and ruin!&apos;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#138_n3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And Ajātasattu summoned the Magadhan chief minister,<br/>
					brahman Vassakara, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Go, brahman, visit the Exalted One<br/>
					and in my name bow your head at his feet;<br/>
					ask whether he be free of sickness,<br/>
					of ailment,<br/>
					at ease,<br/>
					hale and comfortable;<br/>
					say to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Lord, rajah Ajātasattu salutes the Exalted One<br/>
					and asks if he be in health.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">And speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;The Magadhan rajah, Ajātasattu, the Videhan&apos;s son,<br/>

					I&apos;ll root them out,<br/>
					I&apos;ll destroy them,<br/>
					I&apos;ll reduce these Vajjians to wretchedness and ruin!&apos;&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">As the Exalted One answers,<br/>
					that study carefully and tell me.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="138_pg12"><span class="f2 g"><b>[12]</b></span></a> &apos;Yes, sir,&apos; replied brahman Vassakara;<br/>
					and he approached the Exalted One,<br/>
					greeted him and,<br/>
					after exchanging the usual polite talk,<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And so seated, he spoke thus to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Master Gotama, the rajah of Magadha, Ajātasattu, the Videhan&apos;s son,<br/>
					bows his head at Master Gotama&apos;s feet,<br/>
					and asks if he be in health.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">And speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;The Magadhan rajah, Ajātasattu, the Videhan&apos;s son,<br/>
					is anxious to attack the Vajjians;<br/>
					and he has declared:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Though they be so powerful and strong,<br/>
					I&apos;ll root them out,<br/>
					I&apos;ll destroy them,<br/>
					I&apos;ll reduce these Vajjians to wretchedness and ruin!&apos;&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Ānanda stood behind the Exalted One fanning him.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#138_n4" id="fn4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then said the Exalted One to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;What think you, Ānanda, have you heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Vajjians are often assembled,<br/>
					much in assembly?&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, lord, I have heard<br/>
					the Vajjians are often assembled,<br/>
					much in assembly.</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Well, so long as the Vajjians are often assembled,<br/>
					much in assembly,<br/>
					growth may be expected,<br/>

					<p class="f4">&apos;What think you, Ānanda, have you heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Do the Vajjians sit down in concord,<br/>
					rise up in concord,<br/>
					do business in concord?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, lord, I have heard<br/>
					the Vajjians sit down in concord,<br/>
					rise up in concord,<br/>
					do business in concord.</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Well, so long as they shall sit down in concord,<br/>
					rise up in concord,<br/>
					do business in concord,<br/>
					growth may be expected,<br/>
					not decline.</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;What think you, Ānanda, have you heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Do the Vajjians not decree the undecreed<br/>
					nor repeal the decreed,<br/>
					but conform to the ancient Vajjian laws as decreed?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, lord, I have heard<br/>
					the Vajjians do not decree the undecreed<br/>
					nor repeal the decreed,<br/>
					but conform to the ancient Vajjian laws as decreed.</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Well, so long as they shall not decree the undecreed<br/>

					but conform to the ancient Vajjian laws as decreed,<br/>
					growth may be expected,<br/>

					<p class="f4">&apos;What think you, Ānanda, have you heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Do the Vajjians honour,<br/>
					respect,<br/>
					venerate,<br/>
					revere the Vajjian elders,<br/>
					and hold they ought to be listened to?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, lord, I have heard<br/>
					the Vajjians honour,<br/>
					respect,<br/>
					venerate,<br/>
					revere the Vajjian elders,<br/>
					and hold they ought to be listened to.</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Well, so long as they shall honour,<br/>

					<p class="f4">&apos;What think you, Ānanda, have you heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Do the Vajjians not forcibly kidnap<br/>
					and make live with them<br/>
					women and girls of their own clan?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, lord, I have heard<br/>
					the Vajjians do not forcibly kidnap<br/>
					and make live with them<br/>
					women and girls of their own clan.</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Well, so long as they shall not forcibly kidnap<br/>
					and make live with them<br/>
					women and girls of their own clan,<br/>
					growth may be expected,<br/>

					<p class="f4">&apos;What think you, Ānanda, have you heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Do the Vajjians honour,<br/>
					respect,<br/>
					venerate,<br/>
					revere the Vajjian shrines<br/>
					within and without (their borders),<br/>
					and not fail to provide meet offerings<br/>
					as given of yore,<br/>
					made of yore?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, lord, I have heard<br/>
					the Vajjians honour,<br/>
					respect,<br/>
					venerate,<br/>
					revere the Vajjian shrines<br/>
					within and without (their borders),<br/>
					and do not fail to provide meet offerings<br/>
					as given of yore,<br/>
					made of yore.</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Well, so long as they shall honour,<br/>
					respect,<br/>

					revere the Vajjian shrines<br/>
					within and without (their borders),<br/>
					shall not fail to provide meet offerings<br/>
					as given of yore,<br/>
					made of yore,<br/>
					growth may be expected,<br/>
					not decline.</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;What think you, Ānanda, have you heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Do the Vajjians provide meet protection,<br/>
					refuge,<br/>
					shelter for Vajjian arahants<br/>
					and is it known<br/>
					that arahants from abroad<br/>
					may come thither<br/>
					and that those there dwell in comfort?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, lord, I have heard<br/>
					the Vajjians provide meet protection,<br/>
					refuge,<br/>
					shelter for Vajjian arahants<br/>
					and is it known<br/>
					that arahants from abroad<br/>
					may come thither<br/>
					and that those there dwell in comfort.</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Well, so long as meet protection,<br/>
					refuge,<br/>
					shelter shall be provided for Vajjian arahants<br/>
					and it shall be known<br/>
					that arahants from abroad<br/>
					may come thither<br/>
					and that those there dwell in comfort,<br/>
					growth may be expected,<br/>
					not decline.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said the Exalted One to brahman Vassakara:</p>

					<p class="f4">Now I was once staying at Sārandada shrine near <a href="#134_vesali">Vesālī</a><br/>
					and there I taught the Vajjians<br/>
					these seven things that cause not decline;<br/>
					and so long, brahman,<br/>
					as these seven things that cause not decline<br/>
					shall endure among the Vajjians<br/>
					and they conform thereto,<br/>
					growth may be expected,<br/>
					not decline.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he had spoken,<br/>
					the Magadhan chief minister said:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Then, Master Gotama,<br/>
					possessed of any one of the things that cause not decline,<br/>
					growth for the Vajjians may be expected,<br/>
					not decline;<br/>
					but what will be said if they have all seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">In sooth, Master Gotama,<br/>
					the Vajjians cannot be overcome by the Magadhan rajah, Ajātasattu,<br/>
					the Videhan&apos;s son,<br/>
					that is not in battle,<br/>
					but only by cunning,<br/>
					by breaking up their alliance.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#138_n5" id="fn5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Well, now we must be going<br/>
					for we have much to do,<br/>
					much business.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="138_pg13"><span class="f2 g"><b>[13]</b></span></a> &apos;Do as you think fit, brahman.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then brahman Vassakara,<br/>
					pleased and gratified,<br/>
					arose and departed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Once, when the Exalted One dwelt near <a href="#134_campa">Campā</a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#295_n1" id="fn1">1</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					on the banks of lake Gaggarā,<br/>
					a company of lay-disciples from Campā visited the venerable Sāriputta,<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And seated thus, they said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;&apos;Tis long, reverend<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#295_n2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span> sir,<br/>
					since we heard a Dhamma-talk from the Exalted One&apos;s mouth;<br/>
					how good it would be to do so!&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Then come next Observance<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#295_n3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span> day, friends,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#295_n4" id="fn4">4</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					and maybe you&apos;ll hear a Dhamma-talk from the Exalted One&apos;s mouth&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Yes, reverend sir,&apos; they rejoined;<br/>
					and getting up,<br/>
					the lay-disciples from Campā saluted the venerable Sāriputta and departed,<br/>
					keeping him on their right.</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4">Now when the day was come,<br/>
					they approached the venerable one,<br/>
					saluted<br/>
					and stood at one side;<br/>
					and with them the venerable Sāriputta visited the Exalted One,<br/>
					saluted and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Lord,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#295_n2">2</a>]</sup></span> may a man&apos;s gift<br/>
					be given here in such a way<br/>
					as to become not great in fruit, great in profit;<br/>
					and may the gift be given in such a way<br/>
					as to become great in fruit, great in profit?&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;It may, Sāriputta.</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx408 marl6">
							<p>The text here for Sariptta&apos;s question reads: <i>na mahapphalaɱ na mahānisaɱsaɱ.</i>, &quot;not of great fruit not of great profit&quot;, but here and hereafter for Gotama&apos;s response reads: <i>mahapphalaɱ na mahānisaɱsaɱ.</i> &apos;of great fruit, not of great profit.&apos; When Sāriputta then asks for a reasoned explanation, he alters his question to conform to the way in which Gotama states the matter. According to a note to the text the first &apos;na&apos; in Sāriputta&apos;s question is left out in all mss. except T. M.<sub>6</sub>[Turnour Morris Mss]. In the concluding paragraph of the text the wording reverts to: <i>na mahapphalaɱ na mahānisaɱsaɱ.</i>. The fact is that on the face of it the outcomes of the lesser gifts described here must surely be counted as being of great fruit, and that gifts of lesser scope than the examples given here are always spoken of as bearing great fruit. But as to profit the final outcome for the one giving to improve his mind conforms to the goal of the Dhamma and is shown to be the greater because of that. The most natural rendering would be for Sāriputta&apos;s question to have been &quot;not of great fruit, not of great profit&quot;, then for Gotama&apos;s response to have been &apos;of great fruit, not of great profit&apos;, and then for Sariptutta to have altered his question to &apos;of great fruit of great profit&apos; and for the conclusion to have been the sequence &apos;of great fruit, not of great profit&apos;; &apos;of great fruit, of great profit.&apos; It is a common occurance for suttas to conclude with a repetition of the opening statement, so it is likely that, the incorrect concusion was formed from Sāriputtas question rather than Gotama&apos;s first statement. I think we are being asked to make a distinction between &apos;fruit&apos; and &apos;profit.&apos; Bhks. Thanissaro and Bodhi, and Sister Upalavana all overlook this problem.</p>

					when you have fed them,<br/>
					you should declare the offering to be mine -<br/>

					<p class="f4">Reverend sir, let all the merit<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#303_n13" id="fn13">13</a>]</sup></span> in this giving<br/>

					<p class="f4">&quot;It is marvellous and wonderful, O mother of Nanda,<br/>

					with a deva<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#303_n14" id="fn14">14</a>]</sup></span> so powerful,<br/>
					so mighty!&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Reverend sir, that is not the only marvellous thing that has happened to me,<br/>
					there is indeed another!</p>

					<p class="f4">Rajahs, for some reason,<br/>
					took by force and slew my only son, Nanda,<br/>

					or being seized,<br/>
					bound<br/>
					or being bound,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#303_n15" id="fn15">15</a>]</sup></span><br/>

					<p class="f4">&quot;It is marvellous and wonderful, O mother of Nanda,<br/>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Nor is that all, reverend sir,<br/>
					that is not the only marvellous thing that has happened to me,<br/>
					there is indeed another!</p>

					<p class="f4">When my husband died,<br/>
					he rose among the yakkhas;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#303_n17" id="fn17">17</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					and he revealed himself to me in his old form;<br/>

					that is not the only marvellous thing that has happened to me,<br/>
					there is indeed another!</p>

					<p class="f4">From the day I, a young girl,<br/>
					was brought to my husband,<br/>
					then but a youth,<br/>
					I know of no trespass<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#303_n18" id="fn18">18</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					even in thought<br/>
					against my husband,<br/>
					how then in deed?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is marvellous, O mother of Nanda, that you should have so purged the surges of the heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Nor is that all, reverend sir,<br/>
					that is not the only marvellous thing that has happened to me,<br/>
					there is indeed another!</p>

					<p class="f4">From the day I became a confessed lay-disciple,<br/>
					I know of no intentional transgression<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#303_n19" id="fn19">19</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					of any step of the training.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">It is marvellous, O mother of Nanda, it is wonderful!</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Nor is that all, reverend sir,<br/>
					that is not the only marvellous thing that has happened to me,<br/>
					there is indeed another!</p>

					<p class="f4">For just as long as I wish,<br/>
					being aloof from sense desires,<br/>
					aloof from evil thoughts,<br/>
					I enter and abide in the first musing,<br/>
					where thought is speculative,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#303_n20" id="fn20">20</a>]</sup></span> deliberative,<br/>
					where zest and ease are born of solitude:<br/>
					suppressing such thought,<br/>
					I enter and abide in the second musing,<br/>
					where there is an inward tranquillizing of the mind,<br/>
					a one-pointedness<br/>
					free from speculation,<br/>
					deliberation,<br/>
					where zest and ease are born of concentration:<br/>
					then, free from the fervour of zest,<br/>
					I enter and abide in the third musing,<br/>
					I abide poised,<br/>
					mindful,<br/>
					self-possessed,<br/>
					I experience the ease of person whereof Ariyans declare:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;The poised and mindful dwells at ease&quot;:</p>

					<p class="f4">then by putting away ease,<br/>
					by putting away ill,<br/>
					by the passing away of former weal and woe of mind,<br/>
					I enter and abide in the fourth musing,<br/>
					a purity that is poise and mindfulness,<br/>
					which is neither ill nor ease.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">It is marvellous, O mother of Nanda, it is wonderful!</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Reverend sir, that is not all, there is yet another marvellous thing!</p>

					<p class="f4">Those five lower fetters,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#303_n21" id="fn21">21</a>]</sup></span> declared by the Exalted One -<br/>
					I perceive not one in myself unabandoned.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">It is marvellous, wonderful, mother of Nanda!</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta instructed Nanda&apos;s mother with Dhamma-talk,<br/>
					incited her,<br/>
					inspired her,<br/>
					gladdened her;<br/>
					and rising from his seat,<br/>
					he departed.</p>

					saluted<br/>
					and stood at one side.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					vanished from Mount Vulture Peak<br/>

					<p class="f4">And Brahmā Tissa saw the venerable one from afar, coming along,<br/>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Herein, Moggallāna,<br/>

					<p class="f4">If,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#350_n20" id="fn20">20</a>]</sup></span> Moggallāna, a monk has learnt this<br/>

					he recognizes each condition;<br/>
					recognizing each condition,<br/>
					he understands each condition;<br/>
					understanding eaeh condition,<br/>
					whatever feeling he feels<br/>
					— pleasant, painful or neither —<br/>
					he abides seeing the impermanence of those feelings,<br/>

					regarding them as something to be renounced.<br/>
					Living in <a id="350_pg54"><span class="f2 g"><b>[54]</b></span></a> such contemplation,<br/>
					he cleaves not to anything in the world;<br/>
					not cleaving to anything,<br/>
					he craves<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#350_n21" id="fn21">21</a>]</sup></span> not;<br/>
					not craving for anything,<br/>
					he becomes just completely cool in himself;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#350_n22" id="fn22">22</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					and he knows:<br/>
					Birth is destroyed,<br/>
					lived is the godly life,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Verily, Moggallāna, in this manner, briefly,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near <a href="#134_savatthi">Sāvatthī,</a> at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika&apos;s Park</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;And early one morning,<br/>
					after robing himself,<br/>
					the Exalted One, taking bowl and cloak,<br/>
					went to the home of Anāthapiṇḍika, the householder;<br/>
					and when he was come,<br/>
					he sat down on the seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the people of the house were making a great noise and clatter;<br/>
					and when Anāthapiṇḍika had come and saluted him<br/>
					and had sat down at one side,<br/>
					the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Why, housefather, do the people of your house<br/>
					make all this din and uproar?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just like fisherfolk<br/>
					with a great haul,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#402_n1" id="fn1">1</a>]</sup></span> methinks!&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Lord, it is Sujata,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#402_n2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span> my daughter-in-law,<br/>
					who lives with us.</p>

					<p class="f4">She is rich and has been brought here from a wealthy family.</p>

					<p class="f4">She pays no heed to her mother-in-law,<br/>
					nor to her father-in-law,<br/>
					nor to her husband;<br/>
					neither does she venerate,<br/>
					honour,<br/>
					reverence<br/>
					nor respect the Exalted One.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One called to her, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, Sujata!<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#402_n3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Yes, lord,&apos; she replied,<br/>
					and came and saluted the Exalted One<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Sujata, a man may have these seven kinds of wives.</p>

					<p class="f4">What seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">One like a slayer,<br/>

					I will speak, Sujata.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Yes, lord,&apos; she replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

							A gossip and a shrew with strident voice,<br/>
							Who brings to low account her husband&apos;s zeal<br/>
							And industry -<br/>
							Let her be called: a mistress and a wife!</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Whoever and with loving sympathy,<br/>
							Just as a mother for her only son,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#402_n6" id="fn6">6</a>]</sup></span><br/>
							For husband cares, and o&apos;er his stored-up wealth<br/>
							Keeps watch and ward -<br/>
							Let her be called: a mother and a wife!</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Who holds her husband in the same regard<br/>
							As younger sister holds the elder born,<br/>
							The meek in heart, who in his every wish<br/>
							Her husband serves -<br/>
							Let her be called: a sister and a wife!</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="402_pg58"><span class="f2 g"><b>[58]</b></span></a> And she who is as glad her lord to see<br/>
							As boon companions long apart to meet,<br/>
							A gracious character of gentle birth,<br/>
							A fond helpmate -<br/>
							Let her be called: companion and a wife!</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">If fearless of the lash and stick,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#402_n7" id="fn7">7</a>]</sup></span> unmoved,<br/>
							All things enduring, calm and pure in heart,<br/>
							She bear obedience to her husband&apos;s word,<br/>
							From anger free -<br/>
							Let her be called: a handmaid<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#402_n8" id="fn8">8</a>]</sup></span> and a wife!</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Now she who&apos;s called: a mistress, slayer, thief,<br/>
							Who&apos;s harsh, immoral, lacking in respect,<br/>
							When cometh death -<br/>
							Will wander in the miseries of hell.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">But mother, sister or companion, slave,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#402_n9" id="fn9">9</a>]</sup></span><br/>
							In precept long established and restrained,<br/>
							When cometh death -<br/>
							Will wander in the happy heaven world.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#402_n10" id="fn10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">These, Sujata, are the seven kinds of wives a man may have;<br/>
					and which of them are you?</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Lord, let the Exalted One think of me as a handmaid<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#402_n11" id="fn11">11</a>]</sup></span> and a wife<br/>
					from this day forth.&apos;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">In bygone days, monks,<br/>
					there was a teacher named Sunetta,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#412_n21" id="fn21">21</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					a course-setter,<br/>
					who was free from all lustful passions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now <a id="412_pg68"><span class="f2 g"><b>[68]</b></span></a> he had many hundreds of disciples,<br/>
					to whom he taught the doctrine of fellowship in Brahma&apos;s world.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#412_n22" id="fn22">22</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And all they who grasped the word taught by Sunetta,<br/>
					in its fullness,<br/>
					on the breaking up of the body after death,<br/>
					were reborn in the realm of bliss,<br/>
					the Brahma-world.</p>

					<p class="f4">But of those who did not grasp the word in full,<br/>
					some, after death,<br/>
					were reborn into the fellowship of the devas<br/>
					who have power over others&apos; creations,<br/>
					some among the devas who delight in creating,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#412_n23" id="fn23">23</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					some among the Tusita devas,<br/>
					some among the Yama devas,<br/>
					some among the devas of the Thirty,<br/>
					some in the company of the Four Royal devas,<br/>
					some among wealthy nobles,<br/>
					some among wealthy brahmans<br/>
					and some among wealthy householders.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Now Sunetta, the teacher, thought thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;It is not seemly<br/>
					that I should have precisely the same mode of existence<br/>
					as my disciples after death.</p>

					<p class="f4">What if I were to make amity<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#412_n24" id="fn24">24</a>]</sup></span> become<br/>
					to a perfect degree!&quot;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And Sunetta, the teacher,<br/>
					cultivated the thought of amity<br/>
					for seven years,<br/>
					and then for seven world-cycles<br/>
					returned not to this world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then when the world rolled on, he arose in the sphere of Radiance;<br/>
					then when the world rolled back,<br/>
					he arose in Brahmā&apos;s empty palace.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, he became Brahmā,<br/>
					the conqueror,<br/>
					unconquered,<br/>
					all-seeing,<br/>
					all-powerful.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thirty-six times he was Sakka, the deva-king.</p>

					<p class="f4">Many time seven he was a Wheel-turning rajah,<br/>
					just,<br/>
					righteous,<br/>
					conquering the fur ends of the earth,<br/>
					bringing stability to the country,<br/>
					possessing the seven gems.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#412_n25" id="fn25">25</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet, monks,<br/>
					although Sunetta lived so long<br/>
					and lasted such a time,<br/>
					he was not freed from birth,<br/>
					old age and death,<br/>
					from weeping and lamentation,<br/>
					from pain,<br/>
					grief<br/>
					and tribulation.</p>

					<p class="f4">He was not freed from ill, I say.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">It was by not being awake to,<br/>
					by not penetrating four conditions.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, it was by not being awake to,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#412_n26" id="fn26">26</a>]</sup></span> by not penetrating <a id="412_pg69"><span class="f2 g"><b>[69]</b></span></a> Ariyan right conduct;<br/>

							<h4>SBE X pg65</h4>
							
							<p class="f4">264. Not by tonsure does an undisciplined man who speaks falsehood become a Samana; can a man be a Samana who is still held captive by desire and greediness?</p>
							
							<p class="f4">265. He who always quiets the evil, whether small or large, he is called a Samana (a quiet man), because he has quieted all evil.</p>
							
							<p class="f4">266. A man is not a mendicant (Bhikshu) simply because he asks others for alms; he who adopts the whole law is a Bhikshu, not he who only begs.</p>
							
							<p class="f4">267. He who is above good and evil, who is chaste, who with knowledge passes through the world, he indeed is called a Bhikshu.</p>
							
							<p class="f4">268., 269. A man is not a Muni because he observes silence (mona, i.e. mauna), if he is foolish</p>
							
							<p class="f4">[265. This is a curious etymology, because it shows that at the time when this verse was written, the original meaning of sramana had been forgotten. Sramana meant originally, in the language br the Brahmans, a man who performed hard penances, from sram, &apos;to work hard,&apos; etc. When it became the name of the Buddhist ascetics, thelanguage had changed, and sramana was pronounced samana. Now there is another Sanskrit root, sam, &apos;to quiet,&apos; which in Pâli becomes likewise sam, and from this root sam, &apos;to quiet,&apos; and not from sram, &apos;to tire,&apos; did the popular etymology of the day and the writer of our verse derive the title of the Buddhist priests. The original form sramana became known to the Greeks as {Greek: Sarmanai}, that of samana as {Greek: Samanaioi}; the former through Megasthenes, the latter through Bardesanes, 80-60 B.C. (See Lassen, Indische Alterthumskunde, II, 700.) The Chinese Shamen and the Tungusian Shamen come from the same source, though the latter has sometimes been doubted. See Schott, Über die doppelte Bedeutung des Wortes Schamane, in the Philosophical Transactions of the Berlin Academy, 1842, p. 463 seq.</p>
							
							<p class="f4">266-270. The etymologies here given of the ordinary titles of the followers of Buddha are entirely fanciful, and are curious only as showing how the people who spoke Pâli had lost the etymological consciousness of their language. A Bhikshu is a beggar, i.e. a Buddhist friar who bas left his family and lives entirely on alms. Muni is a sage, hence Sâkya-muni, a name of Gautama. Muni comes from man, &apos;to think,&apos; and from muni comes mauna, &apos;silence.&apos; Ariya, again, is the general name of those who embrace a religious life. It meant originally &apos;respectable, noble.&apos; In verse 270 it seems as if the writer wished to guard against deriving ariya from ari, &apos;enemy.&apos; See note to verse 22.] [pg. 66] and ignorant; but the wise who, taking the balance, chooses the good and avoids evil, he is a Muni, and is a Muni thereby; he who in this world weighs both sides is called a Muni.</p>
							
							<p class="f4">270. A man is not an elect (Ariya) because he injures living creatures; because he has pity on all living creatures, therefore is a man called Ariya.</p>
							
							<p class="f4">271., 272. Not only by discipline and vows, not only by much learning, not by entering into a trance, not by sleeping alone, do I earn the happiness of release which no worldling can know. Bhikshu, be not confident as long as thou hast not attained the extinction of desires.</p>
