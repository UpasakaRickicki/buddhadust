					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="#11_savatthi">Sāvatthī</a>, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika&apos;s Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Yes, Lord,&quot; replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Monks, whatsoever fears arise,<br/>
					all of them arise as to the fool,<br/>
					not the wise man.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#1_n1" id="fn1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever dangers arise,<br/>
					all of them arise as to the fool,<br/>
					not the wise man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever oppressions of mind arise,<br/>
					all of them arise as to the fool,<br/>
					not the wise man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as, monks, a spark of fire<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#1_n2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					from a hut of reeds or grass<br/>
					burns up houses with gabled roofs,<br/>
					houses plastered inside and out<br/>
					that admit to no wind,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#1_n3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					houses with well-fitting doors and casements,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#1_n4" id="fn4">4</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					even so whatsoever fears arise,<br/>
					all of them arise as to the fool,<br/>
					not the wise man.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Whatsoever dangers arise,<br/>
					all of them arise as to the fool,<br/>
					not the wise man.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Whatsoever oppressions of mind arise,<br/>
					all of them arise as to the fool, not the wise man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, it is the fool<br/>
					who is haunted by fears,<br/>
					dread of dangers,<br/>
					oppression of mind,<br/>
					not the wise man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not as to the wise man cometh fear:<br/>
					not as to the wise man cometh dread of anger:<br/>
					not as to the wise man cometh oppression of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, thus must ye train yourselves:</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning those three conditions<br/>
					by which the fool is to be known, <a id="1_pg88"><span class="f2 g"><b>[88]</b></span></a><br/>
					we will acquire and practice<br/>

					<p class="f4">But it never occurs to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying at Isipatana in the Deer Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Yes, lord,&quot; replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Once upon a time, monks,<br/>
					there was a rajah named Pacetana.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#51_n1" id="fn1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now one day the rajah Pacetana said to his wheelwright:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Master wheelwright, six months hence<br/>
					there will be a battle.</p>

					<p class="f4">Can you make me a new pair of wheels,<br/>
					master wheelwright?&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">I can, your honour,<br/>
					replied the wheelwright to the rajah Pacetana.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well, when six months,<br/>
					less six days,<br/>
					were gone,<br/>
					he had finished but one wheel.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said the rajah to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Master wheelwright,<br/>
					six days hence there will be a battle.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is the new pair of wheels complete?&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Your honour, during these six months,<br/>
					less six days,<br/>
					one wheel is finished.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;But can you finish the second wheel<br/>
					in six days?&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="51_pg96"><span class="f2 g"><b>[96]</b></span></a> &apos;I can, your honour,&apos;<br/>
					rephed the wheelwright.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Well, monks, in six days<br/>
					finishing the second wheel<br/>
					he took the new pair of wheels<br/>
					and went off to see the rajah Pacetana.</p>

					<p class="f4">On getting there he said this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">Here&apos;s the new pair of wheels finished, your honour.</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Master wheelwright,<br/>
					I see no difference,<br/>
					no difference at all<br/>
					between the two wheels,<br/>
					the one you took six months,<br/>
					less six days,<br/>
					to make,<br/>
					and the one you finished in six days.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;But there is a difference, your honour.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let your honour look!&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">So saying, monks,<br/>
					the wheelwright set rolling<br/>
					the wheel he had finished in six days.</p>

					<p class="f4">The wheel kept rolling<br/>
					so long as the impulse that set it moving lasted.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#51_n2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then it circled round and round<br/>
					and fell to the ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he set rolling<br/>
					the wheel which he had finished in six months,<br/>
					less six days.</p>

					<p class="f4">It kept rollng<br/>
					so long as the impulse that set it going lasted,<br/>
					and then stood still, -<br/>
					stuck to the axle,<br/>
					you would have thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">3. &apos;But, master wheelwright,&apos; said the rajah,<br/>
					&apos;what is the reason,<br/>
					what is the cause<br/>
					why the wheel you made in six days<br/>
					rolled on while the impulse lasted,<br/>
					then circled round and round<br/>
					and fell to the ground:<br/>
					whereas the one you made in six months,<br/>
					less six days,<br/>
					stood still, -<br/>
					stuck to the axle,<br/>
					you would have thought?&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Your honour, as to the wheel I finished in six days,<br/>
					its rim was crooked,<br/>
					full of faults and flaws:<br/>
					so were the spokes and hub.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to the crooked,<br/>
					faulty,<br/>
					flawed nature<br/>
					of rim,<br/>
					spokes<br/>
					and hub,<br/>
					when set rolling<br/>
					it went on so long as the impulse that set it going lasted,<br/>
					then circled and fell to the ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, your honour, as to the wheel I took six months,<br/>
					less six days,<br/>
					to finish,<br/>
					its rim was not crooked;<br/>
					it was faultless,<br/>
					flawless:<br/>
					so were the spokes and hub.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to the even,<br/>
					faultless,<br/>
					flawless nature<br/>
					of rim,<br/>
					spokes<br/>
					and hub,<br/>
					the wheel set rolling<br/>
					rolled on so long as the impulse that set <a id="51_pg97"><span class="f2 g"><b>[97]</b></span></a> it moving lasted,<br/>
					then it stood still,-<br/>
					stuck to the axle,<br/>
					you would have thought.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">4. Now, monks, maybe you are thinking<br/>
					that on that occasion<br/>
					that wheelwright was someone else.</p>

					<p class="f4">But you must not so think.</p>

					<p class="f4">I myself was that wheelwright<br/>
					on that occasion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, I was an expert in wood<br/>
					that was crooked,<br/>
					full of faults<br/>
					and flaws.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, I,<br/>
					the Arahant,<br/>
					who am a Fully Enlightened One,<br/>
					am expert in the crooked ways,<br/>
					the faults<br/>
					and flaws<br/>
					of body.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am an expert in the crooked ways,<br/>
					the faults<br/>
					and flaws<br/>
					of speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am an expert in the crooked ways,<br/>
					the faults<br/>
					and flaws<br/>
					of thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">5. Monks, in whatsoever monk or nun<br/>
					the crookedness of body,<br/>
					speech<br/>
					and thought<br/>
					is not abandoned, -<br/>
					such fall<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#51_n3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span> away from this Dhamma-Discipline,<br/>
					just like the wheel<br/>
					that was finished in six days.</p>

					<p class="f4">In whatsoever monk or nun<br/>
					the crookedness of body,<br/>
					speech<br/>
					and thought<br/>
					is abandoned, -<br/>
					such are firm-set in this Dhamma-Discipline,<br/>
					just like the wheel<br/>
					that was finished in six months,<br/>
					less six days.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks,<br/>
					thus must ye train yourselves:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;We will abandon the crookedness,<br/>
					the faults<br/>
					and flaws<br/>
					of body.</p>

					<p class="f4">We will abandon the crookedness,<br/>
					the faults<br/>
					and flaws<br/>
					of speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">We will abandon the crookedness,<br/>
					the faults<br/>
					and flaws<br/>
					of thought.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how ye must train yourselves, monks.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="60_pg98"><span class="f2 g"><b>[98]</b></span></a> And how does he keep watch over the door of his sense faculties?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk, smelling a scent with the none,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection, evil, unprofitable states,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk, contacting a tangible with the body,<br/>

					<p class="f4">That, monks, is how a monk has the door of his faculties guarded.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk moderate in eating?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk takes his food thoughtfully and prudently;<br/>
					not for sport,<br/>
					not for indulgence,<br/>
					not for personal charm or adornment,<br/>

					<p class="f4">In the middle watch of the night,<br/>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Very good, sir,&quot; said the other two<br/>

					<p class="f4">So all three went to visit the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him saluted him<br/>

					<p class="f4">So seated the venerable Sāriputta told the Exalted One<br/>
					<i>[all the talk they had had on the subject].</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Then said the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;It is no easy matter, Sāriputta,<br/>
					to decide off-hand<br/>
					which of these three persons<br/>
					is the most excellent and choice.</p>

					<p class="f4">It may well be that this person<br/>
					who is released by faith<br/>
					is on the path to arahantship;<br/>
					that this one who has testified to the truth with body<br/>
					is a once-returner or a non-returner;<br/>
					that this one who has won view<br/>
					is also a once-returner or a non-returner.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is no easy thing, Sāriputta,<br/>
					to decide off-hand about this matter.</p>

					<p class="f4">It may well be that this person<br/>
					who has testified to the truth with body<br/>
					is on the path to arahantship;<br/>
					that the other two are once-returners or non-returners.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or again it may well be that this person<br/>
					who has won view<br/>
					is on the path to arahantship;<br/>
					while the two others are once-returners or non-returners.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed it is no easy task, Sāriputta,<br/>
					to decide off-hand which of these three persons<br/>
					is most excellent and choice.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Monks, those families where mother and father are worshipped in the home are reckoned like unto Brahma.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#143_n2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Those <a id="143_pg115"><span class="f2 g"><b>[115]</b></span></a> families where mother and father are worshipped in the home are ranked with the teachers of old.</p>

					<p class="f4">Worthy of offerings, monks, are those families where mother and father are worshipped in the home.</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Brahma,&apos; monks, is a term for mother and father.</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Teachers of old,&apos; monks, is a term for mother and father.</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Worthy of offerings,&apos; monks, is a term for mother and father.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because mother and father do much for children, they bring them up,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#143_n3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span> nourish and introduce them to the world.&quot;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#143_n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;It may be so, Ānanda that a monk can acquire such concentration<br/>

					<p class="f4">&quot;But, lord, by what process can it be<br/>

					<p class="f4">In this matter, Ānanda, a monk has this idea:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;This is the calm,<br/>
					this is the excellent state, to wit,<br/>
					— rest from all activities,<br/>
					the forsaking of all substrate (of rebirth),<br/>
					the destruction of craving,<br/>

					Nibbāna.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how a monk can acquire such concentration<br/>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, Ānanda, in this connexion<br/>

					<p class="f4">Likewise in all external objects<br/>

					<p class="f4">We will so abide in the attainment of the heart&apos;s release,<br/>

					that we have no notion of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine,&quot;<br/>
					no tendency to vain conceit.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how you must train yourselves.</p>

					<p class="f4">In so far as a monk has no notion of &apos;I&apos; and &apos;mine,&apos;<br/>
					no tendency to vain conceit,<br/>
					likewise in all external objects<br/>
					has no such notion or tendency,<br/>
					and he abides the attainment of the heart&apos;s release,<br/>
					the release by insight,<br/>
					he is called:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;A monk who has cut off craving,<br/>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Āḷavī,<br/>

					<p class="f4">On seeing him he approached<br/>

					<p class="f4">So seated Hatthakka of Āḷavī<br/>

							Stands fast for evermore immovable.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#191_n10" id="fn10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">5. Once upon a time, monks,<br/>

					<p class="f4">O that I could win birth<br/>

					<p class="f4">O that I might sit at the feet<br/>
					of that Exalted One<br/>
					and then that Exalted One would teach me Dhamma,<br/>
					and then I might learn Dhamma<br/>
					from that Exalted One!&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, I say this,<br/>
					not hearing it from some recluse or brahmin;<br/>
					nay, but what I myself have known<br/>
					and seen<br/>
					and heard,<br/>

							Born in a mean estate, must suffer long.<br/>
							Good men, by deva-messengers when warned,<br/>
							Are never slothful in the Ariyan Dhamma;<br/>

							Knowing it for the cause of birth and death,<br/>
							By ending birth and death, freed utterly,<br/>
							They have won calm, those happy ones,<br/>

					<p class="f4">But, monks, this verse was ill sung.</p>

					<p class="f4">It was wrongly,<br/>
					not rightly uttered.</p>

					<p class="f4">How so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, Sakka, lord of the Devas,<br/>
					was not released from birth,<br/>
					old age<br/>
					and death,<br/>
					from sorrow,<br/>
					lamentation<br/>
					and woe.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="208_pg128"><span class="f2 g"><b>[128]</b></span></a> He was not released<br/>
					from despair and tribulation.</p>

					<p class="f4">He was not released from Ill,<br/>
					I declare.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whereas the monk who is arahant,<br/>
					one in whom the āsavas are destroyed,<br/>
					who has lived the life,<br/>
					done what was to be done,<br/>
					who has laid down the burden,<br/>

					utterly destroyed the fetter of becoming,<br/>
					who is perfectly released by knowledge, -<br/>
					by such an one this saying of:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">&apos;He who would be like unto me should keep<br/>
							The fourteenth, fifteenth day and eke the eighth<br/>
							Of the half-month, likewise the extra fast,<br/>
							To observance of the precepts eight well given.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">were fitly uttered.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because that monk is fully released from birth,<br/>
					old age<br/>
					and death,<br/>
					from sorrow,<br/>
					lamentation<br/>
					and woe:<br/>
					he is fully released<br/>
					from despair and tribulation.</p>

					exceeding delicately nurtured,<br/>
					delicately nurtured beyond measure.</p>

					<p class="f4">For instance,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#215_n3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					in my father&apos;s house<br/>
					lotus-pools were made thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">one of blue lotuses,<br/>
					one of red lotuses,<br/>
					another of white lotuses,<br/>

					<p class="f4">No sandal-wood powder did I use<br/>

					of Kasi cloth was my jacket,<br/>
					my tunic<br/>

					<p class="f4">By night and day<br/>
					a white canopy was held over me,<br/>
					lest cold or heat,<br/>
					dust or chaff<br/>
					or dew,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, monks,<br/>

					<p class="f4">I came not down from my palace<br/>

					and my attention shall be established unshaken.</p>

					<p class="f4">Calmed shall my body be,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Thus making self predominant,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#227_n4" id="fn4">4</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					he abandons evil,<br/>
					cultivates goodness,<br/>
					abandons things blameworthy,<br/>
					cultivates things blameless,<br/>
					and keeps himself in perfect purity.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#227_n5" id="fn5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a monk who has gone to the forest,<br/>
					the root of a tree<br/>

					thus reflects:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;It was not for the sake of robes<br/>
					that I went forth from the home<br/>
					to the homeless life,<br/>
					not for alms<br/>
					or lodging,<br/>
					not for the sake of becoming such and such (in future lives).</p>

					<p class="f4">Nay, it was with this idea:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Here am I, fallen on birth,<br/>
					old age<br/>
					and death,<br/>
					on sorrows,<br/>
					lamentation<br/>
					and woes,<br/>
					on despair<br/>
					and tribulations.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am fallen on Ill,<br/>
					foredone with Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Perhaps so doing<br/>
					some ending of all this mass of Ill<br/>
					may be revealed to me.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet if I,<br/>
					who went forth thus from home<br/>
					to the homeless life,<br/>
					should indulge sensual thoughts,<br/>
					indulge in malicious thoughts,<br/>
					in harmful thoughts, -<br/>
					great is this company of men in the world -<br/>
					surely in this great company<br/>
					there are recluses and brahmins,<br/>
					possessed of supernormal powers,<br/>
					clairvoyant,<br/>
					able to read the thoughts of others.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even from afar<br/>
					they can see me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Though close at hand<br/>
					they may be invisible<br/>
					and they can read my mind with theirs.</p>

					<p class="f4">They would know me thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Behold this clansman here, my friends,<br/>
					who, though in faith he went forth from the home<br/>
					to the homeless life,<br/>
					yet lives his life mixed up <a id="227_pg132"><span class="f2 g"><b>[132]</b></span></a><br/>
					with things evil and unprofitable.&quot;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#227_n6" id="fn6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">There must be devas, too,<br/>
					of supernormal powers,<br/>
					clairvoyant,<br/>
					able to read the thoughts of others.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even from afar<br/>
					they can see me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Though close at hand<br/>

					yet lives his life mixed up<br/>
					with things evil and unprofitable.&quot;&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he thus reflects:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Energetic shall be my striving<br/>
					and my attention shall be established unshaken.</p>

					<p class="f4">Calmed shall my body be,<br/>
					not turbulent.</p>

					<p class="f4">My mind shall be controlled<br/>
					and one-pointed.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus likewise making the world predominant<br/>
					he abandons evil,<br/>
					cultivates goodness,<br/>
					abandons things blameworthy,<br/>
					cultivates things blameless,<br/>
					and keeps himself in utter purity.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p class="f4">3. And of what sort is dominance of Dhamma?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a monk who has gone to the forest,<br/>

					or a lonely spot,<br/>
					thus reflects:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Well proclaimed by the Exalted One is Dhamma,<br/>
					seen in this very life,<br/>
					a thing not involving time,<br/>
					inviting one to come and see,<br/>
					leading onward,<br/>
					to be known for themselves by the wise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now I have fellows in the righteous life<br/>
					who abide in knowledge and insight (of Dhamma).<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#227_n7" id="fn7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">If I, who am one that went forth<br/>
					under this well-proclaimed Dhamma-Discipline,<br/>
					should dwell in sloth and negligence,<br/>
					it would be unseemly for me.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he thus reflects:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Energetic shall be my striving<br/>
					and my attention shall be established unshaken.</p>

					<p class="f4">Calmed shall my body be,<br/>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="#11_savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Now Vacchagotta<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#318_n1" id="fn1">1</a>]</sup></span> the Wanderer came to see the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him he greeted him courteously<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat at one side<br/>
					that brahmin said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;I have heard it said, master Gotama,<br/>
					that Gotama the recluse speaks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Alms should be given to me,<br/>
					not to others:<br/>
					to my followers,<br/>
					not to another&apos;s followers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Alms given to me are of great fruit,<br/>
					not so those given to others.</p>

					<p class="f4">Alms given to my followers<br/>
					are of great profit,<br/>
					not alms given to another&apos;s followers.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, master Gotama,<br/>
					do they who say these things<br/>
					correctly repeat the views of the worthy Gotama,<br/>
					without misrepresenting him<br/>
					by uttering an untruth?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do they expound their views<br/>
					in accordance with his teaching,<br/>
					so that one who is of his doctrine,<br/>
					of his way of thinking,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#318_n2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					may not give grounds for reproach<br/>
					in stating it?</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed we are anxious not to misrepresent the worthy Gotama.&quot;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="318_pg144"><span class="f2 g"><b>[144]</b></span></a> &quot;Those who say so, Vaccha,<br/>
					are not of my way of thinking.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover such misrepresent me<br/>
					by stating what is not true<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#318_n3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					but a falsehood.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, Vaccha,<br/>
					whoso prevents another from giving alms,<br/>
					obstructs him in three ways,<br/>
					robs him of three things.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">He obstructs the giver in acquiring merit:<br/>
					he prevents the receivers from getting a gift:<br/>
					and his own self is already ruined,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#318_n4" id="fn4">4</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					utterly ruined.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoso prevents another from giving alms, Vaccha,<br/>
					obstructs him in three ways,<br/>
					robs him of three things.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">But this is what I really do declare, Vaccha:-</p>

					<p class="f4">If one should throw away pot-scourings<br/>
					or the rinsings of cups<br/>
					into a pool<br/>
					or cesspit,<br/>
					even with the idea of feeding<br/>
					the creatures that live therein,<br/>
					I declare it would be a source<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#318_n5" id="fn5">5</a>]</sup></span> of merit to him;<br/>
					to say nothing of his feeding beings that are human.</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4">Nevertheless I say, Vaccha,<br/>
					that a gift given in the case of the virtuous<br/>
					is of great fruit,<br/>
					not those given in the case of the wicked.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">By &apos;virtuous&apos; I mean<br/>
					one who has abandoned five qualities<br/>
					and possesses five qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the five qualities<br/>
					he has abandoned?</p>

					<p class="f4">Sensual desire is abandoned,<br/>
					malevolence is abandoned,<br/>
					sloth-and-torpor is abandoned,<br/>
					excitement-and-flurry is abandoned,<br/>
					doubt-and-wavering is abandoned.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the five.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what five qualities<br/>
					is he possessed?</p>

					<p class="f4">He possesses the constituents of morality<br/>
					possessed by the adept,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#318_n6" id="fn6">6</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					he possesses the constituents of concentration,<br/>
					possessed by the adept,<br/>
					he possesses the constituents of insight,<br/>
					possessed by the adept,<br/>
					he possesses the constituents of emancipation,<br/>
					possessed by the adept,<br/>
					he possesses the constituents of release by knowledge and vision<br/>
					possessed by the adept,.</p>

					<p class="f4">He has these five qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, where five qualities are abandoned<br/>
					and five possessed,<br/>
					a gift is of great fruit,<br/>
					I declare.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Then, brahmin, do you listen.</p>

					enters on the first musing<br/>
					which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					born of solitude,<br/>
					zestful<br/>
					and easeful,<br/>
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by the calming down of thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					he enters on that inward calm,<br/>
					that one-pointedness of mind,<br/>
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					that is born of mental balance,<br/>
					zestful<br/>
					and easeful,<br/>
					which is the second musing,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Then, by the fading out of zest,<br/>

					mindful and composed,<br/>
					and experiences ease through the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having entered on the third musing,<br/>
					which the Ariyans describe in these terms:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;He who is indifferent and mindful dwells happily,&apos; -</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by the abandoning of ease,<br/>

					<p class="f4">(§ iii) He then, with mind thus composed,<br/>

					(applies and)<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#332_n8" id="fn8">8</a>]</sup></span> bends down his mind<br/>
					to acquiring knowledge of his former births.</p>

					<p class="f4">In divers ways he recalls his former births, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">One birth,<br/>
					two births,<br/>
					three, four, five,<br/>
					ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty,<br/>
					a hundred,<br/>
					a thousand,<br/>

					the various destructions of aeons,<br/>
					the various renewals of aeons,<br/>
					both the destructions and renewals of eons, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;I lived there,<br/>
					was named thus,<br/>
					was of such a clan,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Thus he calls to mind<br/>

					his previous states of existence.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="332_pg148"><span class="f2 g"><b>[148]</b></span></a> This is the first knowledge be attains.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ignorance has vanished,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Gone is the darkness,<br/>

					<p class="f4">(§ iv) He then, with mind thus composed,<br/>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="#348_p1" id="p1">1</a>][<a href="#349_p1">bodh</a>]</span> Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="#11_savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Now Jāṇussoṇi,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#347_n1" id="fn1">1</a>]</sup></span> the brahmin, came to see the Exalted One..</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him he greeted him courteously<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat at one side<br/>
					that brahmin said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Master Gotama, he who has a sacrifice to make,<br/>
					or an offering to the dead,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#347_n2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					or a gift of barley in milk,<br/>
					or a gift fit for mendicants,<br/>
					should give it to those brahmins<br/>
					who are possessors of the threefold lore.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;But, brahmin,<br/>
					how do brahmins describe one<br/>
					who has the threefold lore?&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;In this case, master Gotama,<br/>
					a brahmin is well born on both sides,<br/>
					of pure descent from mother and father<br/>
					as far back as seven generations,<br/>
					unsmirched,<br/>
					without reproach in respect of birth,<br/>
					one given to study,<br/>
					one who knows the charms by heart,<br/>
					a past master in the three Vedas,<br/>
					the indexes together with the ritual,<br/>
					the treatise on phonology (as fourth)<br/>
					and the legendary sayings (as fifth):<br/>
					he is a man learned in the idioms<br/>
					and the grammar,<br/>
					one perfect in the science of world-speculation<br/>
					and the signs of the great being.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, master Gotama,<br/>
					is how the brahmins describe<br/>
					a brahmin who has the threefold lore.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Well, brahmin, this description<br/>
					of a brahmin who has the threefold lore is one thing.</p>

					<p class="f4">The description of him who has the threefold lore<br/>
					in the discipline of the Ariyan<br/>
					is quite another thing.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;But how, master Gotama,<br/>
					is one the possessor of the threefold lore<br/>
					in the discipline of the Ariyan?</p>

					<p class="f4">Well for me if the worthy Gotama would teach me<br/>
					according to what method he is so possessed!&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Then, brahmin, do you listen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Apply your mind attentively.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will speak.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">Very well, master,<br/>
					replied Jāṇussoṇi the brahmin to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Herein a monk, aloof from sensuality,<br/>
					aloof from evil states,<br/>
					enters on the first musing<br/>
					which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					born of solitude,<br/>
					zestful<br/>
					and easeful,<br/>
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by the calming down of thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					he enters on that inward calm,<br/>
					that one-pointedness of mind,<br/>
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					that is born of mental balance,<br/>
					zestful<br/>
					and easeful,<br/>
					which is the second musing,<br/>
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by the fading out of zest,<br/>
					he abides indifferent,<br/>
					mindful and composed,<br/>
					and experiences ease through the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having entered on the third musing,<br/>
					which the Ariyans describe in these terms:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;He who is indifferent and mindful dwells happily,&apos; -</p>

					<p class="f4">he abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by the abandoning of ease,<br/>
					by the abandoning of discomfort,<br/>
					by the ending of the happiness and unhappiness<br/>
					that he had before,<br/>
					entering on that state<br/>
					which is neither pleasant nor painful,<br/>
					that utter purity of mindfulness<br/>
					reached by indifference,<br/>
					which is the fourth musing,<br/>
					he abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">He then, with mind thus composed,<br/>
					made pure and translucent,<br/>
					stainless and with its taints vanished away,<br/>
					made pliant and workable,<br/>
					fixed and unperturbed,<br/>
					(applies and) bends down his mind<br/>
					to acquiring knowledge of his former births.</p>

					<p class="f4">In divers ways he recalls his former births, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">One birth,<br/>
					two births,<br/>
					three, four, five,<br/>
					ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty,<br/>
					a hundred,<br/>
					a thousand,<br/>
					a hundred thousand births:<br/>
					the various destructions of aeons,<br/>
					the various renewals of aeons,<br/>
					both the destructions and renewals of eons, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;I lived there,<br/>
					was named thus,<br/>
					was of such a clan,<br/>
					of such a caste,<br/>
					was thus supported,<br/>
					had such and such pleasant and painful experiences,<br/>
					had such length of days,<br/>
					disappeared thence<br/>
					and arose elsewhere:<br/>
					there too I lived,<br/>
					was named thus,<br/>
					was of such a clan,<br/>
					of such a caste,<br/>
					was thus supported,<br/>
					had such and such pleasant and painful experiences,<br/>
					had such length of days,<br/>
					disappeared thence<br/>
					and arose elsewhere.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he calls to mind<br/>
					in all their specific details,<br/>
					in all their characteristics,<br/>
					in many various ways,<br/>
					his previous states of existence.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the first knowledge be attains.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ignorance has vanished,<br/>
					knowledge arises.</p>

					<p class="f4">Gone is the darkness,<br/>
					arisen is the light,<br/>
					as it does for one who abides earnest,<br/>
					ardent<br/>
					and composed in the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">He then, with mind thus composed,<br/>
					made pure and translucent,<br/>
					stainless and with its taints vanished away,<br/>
					made pliant and workable,<br/>
					fixed and unperturbed,<br/>
					(applies and) bends down his mind<br/>
					to acquiring knowledge of the fall and rise of beings<br/>
					from one existence to another.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the deva-sight,<br/>
					purified and surpassing that of men,<br/>
					he beholds beings deceasing<br/>
					and rising up again,<br/>
					beings both mean and excellent,<br/>
					fair and foul,<br/>
					gone to a happy state,<br/>
					gone to a woeful state<br/>
					according to their deeds<br/>
					(so as to say):</p>

					<p class="f4">I myself, master Gotama,<br/>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="#351_p1" id="p1">1</a>][<a href="#352_p1">than</a>][<a href="#353_p1">bodh</a>]</span> Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="#11_savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Now Saŋgārava,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#350_n1" id="fn1">1</a>]</sup></span> the brahmin, came to see the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him he greeted him courteously<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat at one side<br/>
					that brahmin said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">2. &quot;Master Gotama, we brahmins,<br/>
					let me tell you,<br/>
					offer sacrifice<br/>
					and cause others to do so.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, master Gotama<br/>
					whoso offers sacrifice<br/>
					or causes others to do so,<br/>
					one and all are proficient<br/>
					in a practice of merit<br/>
					that affects many persons;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#350_n2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					that is,<br/>
					which results from offering sacrifice.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, master Gotama,<br/>
					he who goes forth<br/>
					as a Wanderer from this or that family,<br/>
					from the home to the homeless life,<br/>
					tames only the single self,<br/>
					calms only the single self,<br/>
					leads to Nibbāna<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#350_n3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					only the single self.</p>

					<p class="f4">So what I say is,<br/>
					thus he is proficient in a practice of merit<br/>
					that affects only one person,<br/>
					as a result of his going forth (as a Wanderer).&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">3. &quot;Well, brahmin, as to that I will question you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you answer as you think fit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think you, brahmin?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this connexion<br/>
					a Tathāgata arises in the world,<br/>
					an Arahant who is a Fully Enlightened One,<br/>
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/>
					Wellfarer,<br/>
					World-knower,<br/>
					incomparable Charioteer of men to be tamed,<br/>
					Teacher of devas and mankind,<br/>
					a Buddha,<br/>
					an Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">He says thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Come! this is the way,<br/>
					this the practice,<br/>
					proficient in which<br/>
					I make known that incomparable <a id="350_pg152"><span class="f2 g"><b>[152]</b></span></a> bliss<br/>
					wbich is steeped in the holy life,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#350_n4" id="fn4">4</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					by my own powers of comprehension realizing it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come ye also!</p>

					<p class="f4">Practise so that ye too<br/>
					may be proficient therein,<br/>
					so that ye too<br/>
					by your own powers of comprehension<br/>
					may realize it<br/>
					and abide therein.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus this teacher teaches Dhamma<br/>
					and others too practise to attain that end.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#350_n5" id="fn5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover there are many hundreds,<br/>
					many thousands,<br/>
					many hundreds of thousands of such.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think you, brahmin?</p>

					<p class="f4">Since this is so,<br/>
					is it a practice of merit<br/>
					affecting only one person<br/>
					or many persons;<br/>
					that is,<br/>
					the result of going forth as a Wanderer?&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;No, master Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">It affects many persons,<br/>
					this going forth.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">3. At these words<br/>
					the venerable Ānanda said this<br/>
					to the brahmin Saŋgārava:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Of these two practices, brahmin,<br/>
					which appeals to you as being the simpler,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#350_n6" id="fn6">6</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					the less troublesome,<br/>
					of greater fruit,<br/>
					profit?&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words<br/>
					the brahmin Saŋgārava said this<br/>
					to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Just like the worthy Gotama<br/>
					and the worthy Ānanda,<br/>
					both are to me<br/>
					worthy of honour and praise.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a second time<br/>
					the venerable Ānanda said<br/>
					to the brahmin Saŋgārava:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;I do not ask you that, brahmin,<br/>
					as to whom you honour and praise.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what I am asking you:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Which of the two practices appeals to you<br/>
					as being the simpler<br/>
					and less troublesome,<br/>
					of greater fruit<br/>
					of greater profit?&apos;&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again the brahmin Saŋgārava said this<br/>
					to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Just like the worthy Gotama<br/>
					and the worthy Ānanda,<br/>
					both are to me<br/>
					worthy of honour and praise.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a third time<br/>
					the venerable Ānanda said<br/>
					to the brahmin Saŋgārava:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;I do not ask you that, brahmin,<br/>
					as to whom you honour and praise.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what I am asking you:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Which of the two practices appeals to you<br/>
					as being the simpler<br/>
					and less troublesome,<br/>
					of greater fruit<br/>
					of greater profit&apos;&quot;?</p>

					<p class="f4">Again the brahmin Saŋgārava said this<br/>
					to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Just like the worthy Gotama<br/>
					and the worthy Ānanda,<br/>
					both are to me<br/>
					worthy of honour and praise.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="350_pg153"><span class="f2 g"><b>[153]</b></span></a> 3. Thereupon the Exalted One thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Even for a third time the brahmin,<br/>
					on being asked a pertinent<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#350_n7" id="fn7">7</a>]</sup></span> question by Ānanda,<br/>
					evades<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#350_n8" id="fn8">8</a>]</sup></span> it,<br/>
					does not reply to it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose I release them<br/>
					from their difficulty.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">So the Exalted One said this<br/>
					to the brahmin Saŋgārava:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Tell me, brahmin.</p>

					<p class="f4">What was the topic of conversation today<br/>
					when the royal party sat together in company<br/>
					in the rajah&apos;s palace?&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;This was the topic of conversation, master Gotama: -</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;In former times, you know,<br/>
					monks were fewer in number:<br/>
					but those possessed of supernormal powers<br/>
					being more numerous,<br/>
					they showed the marvel of more-power.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#350_n9" id="fn9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">But now it is just the opposite.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">That was the topic of conversation today, master Gotama,<br/>
					when the royal party sat together in company<br/>
					in the rajah&apos;s palace.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">4. &quot;Now as to that, brahmin,<br/>
					there are these three marvels.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The marvel of more-power,<br/>
					the marvel of thought-reading,<br/>
					the marvel of teaching.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, brahmin, is the marvel of more-power?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#350_n10" id="fn10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a certain one enjoys sorts of more-power<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#350_n11" id="fn11">11</a>]</sup></span> in divers ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">From being one he becomes many,<br/>
					from being many he becomes one:<br/>
					manifest or invisible<br/>
					he goes unhindered through a wall,<br/>
					through a rampart,<br/>
					through a mountain,<br/>
					as if through the air:<br/>
					he plunges into the earth<br/>
					and shoots up again<br/>
					as if in water:<br/>
					he walks upon the water<br/>
					without parting it<br/>
					as if on solid ground:<br/>
					he travels through the air<br/>
					sitting crosslegged,<br/>
					like a bird upon the wing:<br/>
					even this moon and sun,<br/>
					though of such mighty power and majesty, -<br/>
					he handles them<br/>
					and strokes them with his hand:<br/>
					even as far as the Brahma <a id="350_pg154"><span class="f2 g"><b>[154]</b></span></a> world<br/>
					he has power with his body.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#350_n12" id="fn12">12</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This, brahmin, is called<br/>
					&apos;the marvel of more-power.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">5. And what, brahmin,<br/>
					is the marvel of thought-reading?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#350_n13" id="fn13">13</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">In this case<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#350_n14" id="fn14">14</a>]</sup></span> a certain one<br/>
					can declare by means of a sign:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Thus is your mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such and such is your mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is your consciousness.&apos;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#350_n15" id="fn15">15</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And however much he may tell,<br/>
					so it is<br/>
					and not otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, brahmin,<br/>
					perhaps a certain one<br/>
					does not declare such things by means of a sign,<br/>
					but he does so after hearing a voice from men<br/>
					or non-humans<br/>
					or from devas,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#350_n16" id="fn16">16</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					and says:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Thus is your mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such and such is your mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is your consciousness.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">And however much he may tell,<br/>
					so it is<br/>
					and not otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here again, brahmin,<br/>
					perhaps a certain one<br/>
					does not declare these things by means of a sign,<br/>
					or on hearing a voice from men<br/>
					or non-humans<br/>
					or from devas,<br/>
					but he does so (judging) from some sound he has heard,<br/>
					an utterance intelligently made<br/>
					by one who is reasoning intelligently.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#350_n17" id="fn17">17</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">So hearing he declares:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Thus is your mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such and such is your mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is your consciousness.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">And however much he may tell,<br/>
					so it is<br/>
					and not otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="350_pg155"><span class="f2 g"><b>[155]</b></span></a> Then again, brahmin,<br/>
					in this case suppose a certain one<br/>
					does not declare these things by means of a sign,<br/>
					or on hearing a voice from men<br/>
					or non-humans<br/>
					or from devas,<br/>
					or by (judging) from some sound he has heard,<br/>
					an utterance intelligently made<br/>
					by one who is reasoning intelligently<br/>
					yet maybe,<br/>
					when he has attained a state of concentration<br/>
					which is void of thought applied and sustained,<br/>
					one&apos;s mind can read another&apos;s thoughts<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#350_n18" id="fn18">18</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					and know thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;According to the nature<br/>
					of the thinkings of this worthy,<br/>
					on such and such objects<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#350_n19" id="fn19">19</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					will he immediately<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#350_n20" id="fn20">20</a>]</sup></span> direct his thoughts.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then however much he may tell,<br/>
					so it is<br/>
					and not otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brahmin, is called<br/>
					&apos;the marvel of mind-reading.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">6. And what, brahmin,<br/>
					is the marvel of teaching?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a certain one teaches thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Reason thus,<br/>
					not thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Apply your mind thus,<br/>
					not thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandon this state,<br/>
					acquire that state<br/>
					and abide therein.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brahmin, is called<br/>
					&apos;the marvel of teaching.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">So these are the three marvels.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now of these three marvels,<br/>
					which appeals to you<br/>
					as the more wonderful and excellent&quot;?</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Of these marvels, master Gotama,<br/>
					the marvel of more-power —</p>

					<p class="f4">from being one he becomes many,<br/>
					from being many he becomes one:<br/>
					manifest or invisible<br/>
					he goes unhindered through a wall,<br/>
					through a rampart,<br/>
					through a mountain,<br/>
					as if through the air:<br/>
					he plunges into the earth<br/>
					and shoots up again<br/>
					as if in water:<br/>
					he walks upon the water<br/>

					he travels through the air<br/>
					sitting crosslegged,<br/>
					like a bird upon the wing:<br/>
					even this moon and sun,<br/>
					though of such mighty power and majesty, -<br/>
					he handles them<br/>
					and strokes them with his hand:<br/>
					even as far as the Brahma world<br/>
					he has power with his body —</p>

					<p class="f4">he who performs it has the experience thereof;<br/>
					it is a possession of him who performs it —</p>

					<p class="f4">seems to me to be of the nature of an illusion.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#350_n21" id="fn21">21</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then again as to the marvel of thought-reading —</p>

					<p class="f4">That a certain one<br/>
					can declare by means of a sign:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Thus is your mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such and such is your mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is your consciousness.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">And however much he may tell,<br/>
					so it is<br/>
					and not otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, though he does not declare such things by means of a sign,<br/>
					but he does so after hearing a voice from men<br/>
					or non-humans<br/>
					or from devas,<br/>
					and says:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Thus is your mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such and such is your mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is your consciousness.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">And however much he may tell,<br/>
					so it is<br/>
					and not otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, though he does not declare these things by means of a sign,<br/>
					or on hearing a voice from men<br/>
					or non-humans<br/>
					or from devas,<br/>
					but he does so (judging) from some sound he has heard,<br/>
					an utterance intelligently made<br/>
					by one who is reasoning intelligently.</p>

					<p class="f4">So hearing he declares:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Thus is your mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such and such is your mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is your consciousness.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">And however much he may tell,<br/>
					so it is<br/>
					and not otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, though he does not declare these things by means of a sign,<br/>
					or on hearing a voice from men<br/>
					or non-humans<br/>
					or from devas,<br/>
					or by (judging) from some sound he has heard,<br/>
					an utterance intelligently made<br/>
					by one who is reasoning intelligently<br/>
					yet maybe,<br/>
					when he has attained a state of concentration<br/>
					which is void of thought applied and sustained,<br/>
					one&apos;s mind can read another&apos;s thoughts<br/>
					and know thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;According to the nature<br/>
					of the thinkings of this worthy,<br/>
					on such and such objects<br/>
					will he immediately direct his thoughts.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then however much he may tell,<br/>

					<p class="f4">he who performs it has the experience thereof;<br/>
					it is a possession of him who performs it —</p>

					<p class="f4">also seems to me to be of the nature of an illusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">But as to the marvel of teaching<br/>
					wherein a certain one teaches thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Reason thus,<br/>
					not thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Apply your mind thus,<br/>
					not thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandon this state,<br/>
					acquire that state<br/>
					and abide therein.&apos; —</p>

					<p class="f4">of these three marvels<br/>
					this one appeals to me<br/>
					as the more wonderful and excellent.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is strange, master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is wonderful<br/>
					how well the worthy Gotama<br/>
					has spoken of this thing!</p>

					<p class="f4">We do hold the worthy Gotama<br/>
					to possess all three marvels.</p>

					<p class="f4">Surely the worthy Gotama<br/>
					enjoys sorts of more-power in divers ways, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">From being one he becomes many,<br/>
					from being many he becomes one:<br/>
					manifest or invisible<br/>
					he goes unhindered through a wall,<br/>
					through a rampart,<br/>

					he travels through the air<br/>
					sitting crosslegged,<br/>
					like a bird upon the wing:<br/>
					even this moon and sun,<br/>

					he handles them<br/>
					and strokes them with his hand:<br/>
					even as far as <a id="350_pg156"><span class="f2 g"><b>[156]</b></span></a> the Brahma world<br/>
					he has power with his body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Surely the worthy Gotama&apos;s mind<br/>
					can read another&apos;s thoughts<br/>
					when he has attained a state of concentration<br/>
					void of thought applied and sustained,<br/>
					so as to know:</p>

					<p class="f4">According to the nature<br/>
					of the thinkings of this worthy,<br/>
					on such and such objects<br/>
					will he immediately direct his thoughts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, surely the worthy Gotama<br/>
					teaches thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Reason thus,<br/>
					not thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Apply your mind thus,<br/>
					not thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandon this state,<br/>
					acquire that state<br/>
					and abide therein.&apos;&quot; —</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Indeed, brahmin,<br/>
					your words come close<br/>
					and challenge me to a statement!<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#350_n22" id="fn22">22</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Nevertheless I will satisfy you<br/>
					by replying.</p>

					<p class="f4">I do indeed enjoys sorts of more-power in divers ways, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">From being one I become many,<br/>
					from being many I become one:<br/>
					manifest or invisible<br/>
					I go unhindered through a wall,<br/>
					through a rampart,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Then again, brahmin,<br/>

					<p class="f4">The monks possessed of these three marvellous powers<br/>

					<p class="f4">In this very Order of Monks, brahmin.</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Excellent, master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">Excellent it is, master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">Even as one raises what is overthrown,<br/>
					or shows forth what is hidden,<br/>
					or points out the way to him that wanders astray,<br/>
					or holds up a light in the darkness,<br/>
					that they who have eyes ay see objects, —<br/>
					even so in divers ways<br/>
					hath the Norm been set forth by the worthy Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">I myself, master Gotama,<br/>
					do go for refuge to the worthy Gotama,<br/>

					and to the Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the worthy Gotama<br/>

The sutta is speaking about overcoming terrors, not ways to unite mother and son. Further the Way is not a way to unite mothers and sons except possibly in the sense of both being followers at the same time, that is, being united in an idea, certainly there is no idea here of being united in some after-life.

					<p class="f4">&quot;In this case, brahmin,<br/>

					<p class="f4">When I return from my alms-round<br/>

					and setting mindfulness in front of me.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#389_n12" id="fn12">12</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus aloof from sense-desires,<br/>
					aloof from unprofitable states of mind,<br/>
					I enter on the first musing<br/>
					which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					born of seclusion,<br/>
					zestful and easeful,<br/>
					and abide therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by calming down thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					I enter on that inward calm,<br/>
					that single-minded purpose,<br/>
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					born of mental balance,<br/>
					zestful and easeful,<br/>
					which is the second musing,<br/>
					and abide therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then by the fading out of zest<br/>
					I become balanced<br/>
					and remain mindful and composed,<br/>
					and experience with the body<br/>
					that happiness of which the Ariyans aver:</p>

					<p class="f4">The balanced, thoughtful man lives happily,</p>

					<p class="f4">and I enter on the third musing<br/>
					and abide therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by rejecting pleasure and pain alike,<br/>
					by the coming to an end<br/>
					of the joy and sorrow which I had before,<br/>
					I enter and abide in the fourth musing,<br/>
					free of pain and free of pleasure,<br/>
					a state of perfect purity<br/>

					<p class="f4"><a id="398_pg168"><span class="f2 g"><b>[168]</b></span></a> &quot;I understand the &apos;Dhamma&apos;<br/>
					of the recluses who are Sakyans&apos; sons.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because I understand it<br/>
					that I have deserted that Dhamma-Discipline.&quot;</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4">2. Then a number of monks,<br/>
					having robed themselves,<br/>
					taking bowl and outer robe,<br/>
					entered Rājagaha to beg.</p>

					<p class="f4">And those monks heard Sarabha the Wanderer<br/>
					so speaking<br/>
					in the company at Rājagaha.</p>

					<p class="f4">So when they had done their begging-rounds<br/>
					and had returned and eaten their meal,<br/>
					they went to the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br/>
					they said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Lord, Sarabha the Wanderer<br/>
					has not long since deserted this Dhamma-Discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">At Rājagaha he is thus speaking in the company:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;I understand the &quot;Dhamma&quot;<br/>
					of the recluses who are Sakyans&apos; sons.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because I understand it<br/>
					that I have deserted that Dhamma-Discipline.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, it would be well<br/>
					if the Exalted One were to go to Snake River bank,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#398_n4" id="fn4">4</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					to the Wanderers&apos; Park<br/>
					where is Sarabha the Wanderer,<br/>
					out of compassion for him.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One consented by silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">3. So the Exalted One,<br/>
					rising up from his solitary meditation at eventide,<br/>
					went to Snake River bank,<br/>
					to visit Sarabha the Wanderer<br/>
					in the Wanderers&apos; Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">On reaching this<br/>
					he sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having done so<br/>
					the Exalted One said this<br/>
					to Sarabha the Wanderer:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Is it true, as I hear, Sarabha,<br/>
					that you say:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;I understand the &quot;Dhamma&quot;<br/>
					of the recluses who are Sakyans&apos; sons.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because I understand it<br/>
					that I have deserted that Dhamma-Discipline?&apos;&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words Sarabha the Wanderer was silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a second time<br/>
					the Exalted One spoke to Sarabha the Wanderer, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Speak, Sarabha!</p>

					<p class="f4">How is it that you have understood<br/>
					the &apos;Dhamma&apos; of the recluses who are Sakyans&apos; sons?</p>

					<p class="f4">If your knowledge is incomplete<br/>
					I will complete it for you.</p>

					<p class="f4">If it is complete<br/>
					I shall receive it gladly.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="398_pg169"><span class="f2 g"><b>[169]</b></span></a> And a second time Sarabha the Wanderer was silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then for the third time<br/>
					the Exalted One spoke to Sarabha the Wanderer, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Sarabha, it is by me<br/>
					that the &apos;Dhamma&apos; of the Sakyans&apos; sons<br/>
					who are recluses<br/>
					has been revealed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Speak, Sarabha!</p>

					<p class="f4">How is it that you have understood<br/>
					the &apos;Dhamma&apos; of the recluses who are Sakyans&apos; sons?</p>

					<p class="f4">If your knowledge is incomplete<br/>
					I will complete it for you.</p>

					<p class="f4">If it is complete<br/>
					I shall receive it gladly.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">And a third time Sarabha the Wanderer was silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">4. Thereupon the Wanderers of Rājagaha<br/>
					said this to Sarabha the Wanderer:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Friend, whatever you may have to ask Gotama the recluse,<br/>
					he gives you the opportunity to do so.</p>

					<p class="f4">Speak, reverend Sarabha!</p>

					<p class="f4">If your knowledge is incomplete,<br/>
					Gotama the recluse will complete it for you.</p>

					<p class="f4">If it is complete,<br/>
					he will receive it gladly.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words Sarabha the Wanderer remained silent,<br/>
					confused,<br/>
					hanging his head,<br/>
					looking downwards,<br/>
					a disappointed man,<br/>
					unable to make reply.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#398_n5" id="fn5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">5. So the Exalted One,<br/>
					seeing him in this condition,<br/>
					said to those Wanderers:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Wanderers,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#398_n6" id="fn6">6</a>]</sup></span> if any one should say to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;You have not perfect knowledge of these things,<br/>
					though you claim to be fully enlightened,&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">I should closely examine him,<br/>
					question him<br/>
					and talk with him.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#398_n7" id="fn7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">He, thus closely examined,<br/>
					questioned<br/>
					and talked with,<br/>
					would surely and inevitably<br/>
					be reduced to one of these three conditions: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Either he would shelve the question by another,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#398_n8" id="fn8">8</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					and direct the talk to an alien subject;</p>

					<p class="f4">or he would display anger,<br/>
					malignity<br/>
					and sulkiness;</p>

					<p class="f4">or he would sit silent,<br/>
					confused,<br/>
					hanging his head,<br/>
					looking downwards,<br/>
					a disappointed man,<br/>
					unable to make reply,<br/>
					just as now does Sarabha the Wanderer.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="398_pg170"><span class="f2 g"><b>[170]</b></span></a> Wanderers, if any one were to say to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;The &quot;Dhamma&quot; preached by you<br/>
					for the purpose of utterly destroying Ill<br/>
					does not lead those who act accordingly<br/>
					to such a goal,&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">I should closely examine him,<br/>
					question him<br/>
					and talk with him.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, thus closely examined,<br/>
					questioned<br/>
					and talked with,<br/>
					would surely and inevitably<br/>
					be reduced to one of these three conditions: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Either he would shelve the question by another,<br/>
					and direct the talk to an alien subject;</p>

					<p class="f4">or he would display anger,<br/>
					malignity<br/>
					and sulkiness;</p>

					<p class="f4">or he would sit silent,<br/>
					confused,<br/>
					hanging his head,<br/>
					looking downwards,<br/>
					a disappointed man,<br/>
					unable to make reply,<br/>
					just as now does Sarabha the Wanderer.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One, having thrice<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#398_edn1" id="edfn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span> uttered his lion&apos;s roar<br/>
					in the Wanderers&apos; Park<br/>
					on the bank of Snake River,<br/>
					departed through the air.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#398_n9" id="fn9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">6. Now not long after the departure of the Exalted One<br/>
					those Wanderers assailed Sarabha the Wanderer on all sides<br/>
					with a torrent of abuse,<br/>
					and poking fun at him said:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Friend Sarabha, even as a decrepit jackal<br/>
					in the great forest,<br/>
					thinking to utter a lion&apos;s roar,<br/>
					can only let out just a jackal&apos;s scream,<br/>
					so you, friend Sarabha,<br/>
					thinking to utter the lion&apos;s roar<br/>
					which none but Gotama the recluse can utter, -<br/>
					you give just such a jackal&apos;s scream.</p>

					<p class="f4">Friend Sarabha, just as a poor little hen<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#398_n10" id="fn10">10</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					thinks to crow like a cock,<br/>
					and after all lets out just a poor little hen&apos;s cackle,<br/>
					so you, friend Sarabha,<br/>
					thinking to utter the cock-crow<br/>
					that none but Gotama the recluse can utter,<br/>
					let out just a poor little hen&apos;s cackle.</p>

					<p class="f4">Friend Sarabha, just as a young bull-calf,<br/>
					when the cow-pen is empty,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#398_n11" id="fn11">11</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					thinks he bellows deeply (like an old bull),<br/>
					so you, friend Sarabha,<br/>
					think to utter the deep bellow<br/>
					that none but Gotama the recluse can utter.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus did those Wanderers assail Sarabha the Wanderer<br/>
					with a torrent of abuse,<br/>
					poking fun at him.</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One,<br/>
					while going his rounds among the <a href="#11_kosala">Kosalans</a><br/>
					with a great <a id="408_pg171"><span class="f2 g"><b>[171]</b></span></a> company of monks, came to Kesaputta,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#408_n1" id="fn1">1</a>]</sup></span> a district of the Kosalans.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the Kālāmas of Kesaputta heard it said that Gotama the recluse,<br/>
					the Sakyans&apos; son who went forth as a wanderer from the Sakyan clan,<br/>
					had reached Kesaputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">And this good report was noised abroad about Gotama, that Exalted One, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;He it is, the Exalted One,<br/>
					Arahant,<br/>
					a Fully Enlightened One,<br/>
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/>
					Wellfarer,<br/>
					world-knower,<br/>
					unsurpassed charioteer of men to be tamed,<br/>
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br/>
					a Buddha,<br/>
					an Exalted One.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#408_n2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">It were indeed a good thing to get sight of such arahants!&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">So the Kālāmas of Kesaputta came to see the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">On reaching him, some saluted the Exalted One and sat down at one side:<br/>
					some greeted the Exalted One courteously,<br/>
					and after the exchange of greetings and courtesies<br/>
					sat down at one side:<br/>
					some raising their joined palms to the Exalted One<br/>
					sat down at one side:<br/>
					some proclaimed their name and clan<br/>
					and did likewise;<br/>
					while others without saying anything<br/>
					just sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then as they thus sat<br/>
					the Kālāmas of Kesaputta said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">2. &quot;Sir, certain recluses and brahmins come to Kesaputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">As to their own view,<br/>
					they proclaim and expound it in full:<br/>
					but as to the view of others,<br/>
					they abuse it,<br/>
					revile it,<br/>
					depreciate<br/>
					and cripple it.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#408_n3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, sir, other recluses and brahmins,<br/>
					on coming to Kesaputta,<br/>
					do likewise.</p>

					<p class="f4">When we listen to them, sir,<br/>
					we have doubt and wavering<br/>
					as to which of these worthies is speaking truth<br/>
					and which speaks falsehood.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">3. &quot;Yes, Kālāmas, you may well doubt,<br/>
					you may well waver.</p>

					<p class="f4">In a doubtful matter wavering does arise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now look you, Kālāmas.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Be ye not misled by report<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#408_n4" id="fn4">4</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					or tradition<br/>
					or hearsay.</p>

					<p class="f4">Be not misled by proficiency in the <a id="408_pg172"><span class="f2 g"><b>[172]</b></span></a> collections,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#408_n5" id="fn5">5</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					nor by mere logic or inference,<br/>
					nor after considering reasons,<br/>

					nor because it fits becoming,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#408_n6" id="fn6">6</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					nor out of respect for a recluse (who bolds it).</p>

					<p class="f4">But, Kālāmas, when you know for yourselves:</p>

					<p class="f4">These things are unprofitable,<br/>
					these things are blameworthy,<br/>
					these things are censured by the intelligent;<br/>
					these things, when performed and undertaken,<br/>
					conduce to loss and sorrow, -</p>

					<p class="f4">then indeed do ye reject them, Kālāmas.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">4. Now what think ye, Kālāmas?</p>

					<p class="f4">When greed arises within a man,<br/>
					does it arise to his profit or to his loss?</p>

					<p class="f4">To his loss, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Now, Kālāmas, does not this man, thus become greedy,<br/>
					being overcome by greed<br/>
					and losing control of his mind, -<br/>
					does he not kill a living creature,<br/>
					take what is not given,<br/>
					go after another&apos;s wife,<br/>
					tell lies<br/>
					and lead another into such a state<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#408_n7" id="fn7">7</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					as causes<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#408_n8" id="fn8">8</a>]</sup></span> his loss and sorrow for a long time?&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">He does, sir.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">5. &quot;Now what think ye, Kālāmas?</p>

					<p class="f4">When malice arises within a man,<br/>
					does it arise to his profit or to his loss?&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">To his loss, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Now, Kālāmas, does not this man, thus become malicious,<br/>
					being overcome by malice<br/>
					and losing control of his mind, -<br/>
					does he not kill a living creature,<br/>
					take what is not given,<br/>
					go after another&apos;s wife,<br/>
					tell lies<br/>
					and lead another into such a state<br/>
					as causes his loss and sorrow for a long time?&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">He does, indeed, sir.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">6. &quot;Now what think ye, Kālāmas?</p>

					<p class="f4">When illusion arises within a man,<br/>
					does it arise to his profit or to his loss?&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">To his loss, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;And does not this man, thus deluded,<br/>
					being overcome by delusion<br/>
					and losing control of his mind, -<br/>
					does he not kill a living creature,<br/>
					take what is not given,<br/>
					go after another&apos;s wife,<br/>
					tell lies<br/>
					and lead another into such a state<br/>
					as causes his loss and sorrow for a long time?&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="408_pg173"><span class="f2 g"><b>[173]</b></span></a> &quot;He does, sir.&quot;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">7. &quot;Well then, Kālāmas, what think ye?</p>

					<p class="f4">Are these things profitable or unprofitable?&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">Unprofitable, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Are they blameworthy or not?</p>

					<p class="f4">Blameworthy, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Are they censured by the intelligent or not?</p>

					<p class="f4">They are censured, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;If performed and undertaken,<br/>
					do they conduce to loss and sorrow or not?&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;They conduce to loss and sorrow, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just so, me-thinks.&quot;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#408_n9" id="fn9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">8. &quot;So then, Kālāmas, as to my words to you just now:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Be ye not misled by report or tradition or hearsay.</p>

					<p class="f4">Be not misled by proficiency in the collections,<br/>
					nor by mere logic or inference,<br/>
					nor after considering reasons,<br/>
					nor after reflection on and approval of some theory,<br/>
					nor because it fits becoming,<br/>
					nor out of respect for a recluse (who holds it).</p>

					<p class="f4">But, Kālāmas, when you know for yourselves:</p>

					<p class="f4">These things are unprofitable,<br/>
					these things are blameworthy,<br/>
					these things are censured by the intelligent,<br/>
					these things, when performed and undertaken,<br/>
					conduce to loss and sorrow, -<br/>
					then indeed do ye reject them,&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">such was my reason for uttering those words.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">9. Come now, Kālāmas, be ye not misled by report or tradition or hearsay.</p>

					<p class="f4">Be not misled by proficiency in the collections,<br/>
					nor by mere logic or inference,<br/>
					nor after considering reasons,<br/>
					nor after reflection on and approval of some theory,<br/>
					nor because it fits becoming,<br/>
					nor out of respect for a recluse (who holds it).</p>

					<p class="f4">But if at any time ye know of yourselves:</p>

					<p class="f4">These things are profitable,<br/>
					they are blameless,<br/>
					they are praised by the intelligent:<br/>
					these things, when performed and undertaken,<br/>
					conduce to profit and happiness, -</p>

					<p class="f4">then, Kālāmas, do ye, having undertaken them<br/>
					abide therein.</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;They do conduce to happiness, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, Kālāmas, when you know for yourselves:</p>

					<p class="f4">These things are profitable,<br/>
					they are blameless,<br/>

					these things, when performed and undertaken,<br/>
					conduce to profit and happiness, -</p>

					<p class="f4">then, Kālāmas, do ye, having undertaken them<br/>

					<p class="f4">&apos;These things are good;<br/>
					these things are not blamable;<br/>
					these things are praised by the wise;<br/>
					undertaken and observed,<br/>
					these things lead to benefit and happiness,&apos;<br/>
					do you, having undertaken them, abide therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">The disciple of the Noble Ones, Sāḷha,<br/>
					who in this way is devoid of coveting,<br/>
					devoid of ill will,<br/>
					undeluded,<br/>
					clearly comprehending and mindful,<br/>
					dwells, having pervaded,<br/>
					with the thought of amity,<br/>
					one quarter;<br/>
					likewise the second;<br/>
					likewise the third;<br/>
					likewise the fourth;<br/>
					so above,<br/>
					below,<br/>
					and across;<br/>
					he dwells, having pervaded<br/>
					because of the existence in it<br/>
					of all living beings,<br/>
					everywhere,<br/>
					the entire world,<br/>
					with the great,<br/>
					exalted,<br/>
					boundless thought of amity<br/>
					that is free of hate or malice.</p>

					<p class="f4">He lives, having pervaded,<br/>
					with the thought of compassion,<br/>
					one quarter;<br/>
					likewise the second;<br/>
					likewise the third;<br/>
					likewise the fourth;<br/>
					so above,<br/>
					below,<br/>
					and across;<br/>
					he dwells, having pervaded<br/>
					because of the existence in it<br/>
					of all living beings,<br/>
					everywhere,<br/>
					the entire world,<br/>
					with the great,<br/>
					exalted,<br/>
					boundless thought of compassion<br/>
					that is free of hate or malice.</p>

					<p class="f4">He lives, having pervaded,<br/>
					with the thought of gladness,<br/>
					one quarter;<br/>
					likewise the second;<br/>
					likewise the third;<br/>
					likewise the fourth;<br/>
					so above,<br/>
					below,<br/>
					and across;<br/>
					he dwells, having pervaded<br/>
					because of the existence in it<br/>
					of all living beings,<br/>
					everywhere,<br/>
					the entire world,<br/>
					with the great,<br/>
					exalted,<br/>
					boundless thought of gladness<br/>
					that is free of hate or malice.</p>

					<p class="f4">He lives, having pervaded,<br/>
					with the thought of equanimity,<br/>
					one quarter;<br/>
					likewise the second;<br/>
					likewise the third;<br/>
					likewise the fourth;<br/>
					so above,<br/>
					below,<br/>
					and across;<br/>
					he dwells, having pervaded<br/>
					because of the existence in it<br/>
					of all living beings,<br/>
					everywhere,<br/>
					the entire world,<br/>
					with the great,<br/>
					exalted,<br/>
					boundless thought of equanimity<br/>
					that is free of hate or malice.</p>

					<p class="f4">He comes to know thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">There is a mean state.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is an exalted state.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is an escape from this realm of consciousness.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#417_n6" id="fn6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">When he thus knows,<br/>
					thus sees,<br/>
					his mind is released<br/>
					from the āsava of sensual desire,<br/>
					his mind is released<br/>
					from the āsava of continued becoming,<br/>
					his mind is released from the āsavaof nescience.</p>

					<p class="f4">To him thus released<br/>
					comes the knowledge that he is released,<br/>
					and he is assured:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Ended is rebirth,<br/>
					lived is the righteous life,<br/>
					done is my task,<br/>
					there is no more of this state for me.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">Likewise he comes to know:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Formerly I had greed:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#417_n7" id="fn7">7</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					that was evil.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now it exists no more:<br/>
					that is good.</p>

					<p class="f4">Formerly I had malice:<br/>
					that was evil.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now it exists no more:<br/>
					that is good.</p>

					<p class="f4">Formerly I was deluded:<br/>
					that was evil.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now delusion exists no more:<br/>
					that is good.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus in this very life<br/>
					he is free from craving,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#417_n8" id="fn8">8</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					he is released,<br/>
					he has become cool:<br/>
					he, of himself,<br/>
					abides in experience of bliss,<br/>
					by becoming Brahma.&quot;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#417_n9" id="fn9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="#11_savatthi">Sāvatthī,</a><br/>
					in East Park,<br/>
					in the terraced house of Migāra&apos;s mother.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now <a href="#449_">Visākhā,</a> Migāra&apos;s<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#422_n1" id="fn1">1</a>]</sup></span> mother,<br/>
					on the Sabbath day<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#422_n2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					came to visit the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him she saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As she thus sat the Exalted One said this to Visākhā, Migāra&apos;s mother:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Well, Visākhā!</p>

					<p class="f4">How is it that you come at noon?&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, today I am keeping the Sabbath.</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Well, there are these three Sabbaths, Visākhā.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the three?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the herdsman&apos;s Sabbath,<br/>
					that of the naked ascetics<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#422_n3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span>,<br/>
					and that of the Ariyans.</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4">2. Now what, Visākhā,<br/>
					is the herdsman&apos;s Sabbath?</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, Visākhā,<br/>
					the herdsman at eventide<br/>
					restores the kine to their owners.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he thus reflects:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Today the kine <a id="422_pg186"><span class="f2 g"><b>[186]</b></span></a> grazed at such and such a spot,<br/>
					and drank at such and such a spot.</p>

					<p class="f4">Tomorrow they will graze and drink<br/>
					at such and such a spot.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way<br/>
					some Sabbath-keeper here thus reflects:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Tomorrow I shall eat such and such food,<br/>
					both hard and soft.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">And he spends the day<br/>
					engrossed in that covetous desire.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, Visākhā,<br/>
					is the herdsman&apos;s Sabbath.</p>

					<p class="f4">This Sabbath of the herdsman<br/>
					thus spent<br/>
					is not of great fruit or profit.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not very brilliant.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not of great radiance.</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4">3. And what, Visākhā,<br/>
					is the naked ascetic&apos;s Sabbath?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is a sect of naked ascetics, so called,<br/>
					a sort of recluses,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#422_n4" id="fn4">4</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					who exhort a disciple thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Now, my good fellow,<br/>
					lay aside the stick<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#422_n5" id="fn5">5</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					as regards all creatures that exist<br/>
					eastwards beyond a hundred yojanas:<br/>
					likewise westward,<br/>
					northwards<br/>
					and to the south!&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus they exhort them<br/>
					to kindness and compassion<br/>
					towards some creatures only,<br/>
					but not to others.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again on the Sabbath<br/>
					they exhort a disciple thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Now, good fellow!</p>

					<p class="f4">Off with all your clothes and say:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;I have no part<br/>
					in anything anywhere,<br/>
					and herein for me<br/>
					there is no attachment<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#422_n6" id="fn6">6</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					to anything.&quot;&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet for all that<br/>
					his parents know him for their son<br/>
					and he knows them for his parents.</p>

					<p class="f4">His children and wife<br/>
					know him for father and husband,<br/>
					and he knows them for children and wife.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet for all that<br/>
					his slaves and workmen<br/>
					know him for their master<br/>
					and he in turn knows them<br/>
					for his slaves and workmen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus at a time<br/>
					when one and all should be exhorted (to keep the Sabbath),<br/>
					it is in falsehood that they exhort them.</p>

					<p class="f4">This I declare<br/>
					is as good as telling lies.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, as soon as that night has passed<br/>
					he resumes the use of his belongings,<br/>
					which had not been given back to him really.</p>

					<p class="f4">This I declare<br/>
					is as good as stealing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, Visākhā,<br/>
					is the Sabbath of the naked ascetics.</p>

					<p class="f4">A Sabbath of the naked ascetics thus spent<br/>
					is not of great fruit or profit.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not very brilliant.</p>

					<p class="f4">They whose passion is abandoned,<br/>

					are well-farers in the world.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;It is wonderful, sir!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is marvellous!</p>

					<p class="f4">Here is no trumpeting of one&apos;s own creed,<br/>

					<p class="f4">You have spoken of (man&apos;s) welfare,<br/>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4">5. Now you yourself, worthy Ānanda,<br/>
					preach a doctrine<br/>
					for the abandoning of passion,<br/>
					preach a doctrine<br/>
					for the abandoning of malice<br/>
					preach a doctrine<br/>
					for the abandoning of delusion<br/>
					and your doctrine is well preached.</p>

					<p class="f4">You conduct yourself<br/>
					so as to abandon passion,<br/>
					you conduct yourself<br/>
					so as to abandon malice<br/>
					you conduct yourself<br/>
					so as to abandon delusion, —<br/>
					and you are well conducted in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">In you, worthy Ānanda, passion is abandoned,<br/>
					cut down at the root,<br/>
					made like a palm-tree stump,<br/>
					made such as not to become,<br/>
					of a nature not to spring up again in future time;<br/>
					malice is abandoned,<br/>
					cut down at the root,<br/>
					made like a palm-tree stump,<br/>
					made such as not to become,<br/>

					delusion is abandoned,<br/>
					cut down at the root,<br/>
					made like a palm-tree stump,<br/>

					surely you are a well-farer in the world.</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4">6. Excellent, sir!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is excellent!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is as if one should raise the fallen,<br/>
					open up what is hidden,<br/>
					point out the way<br/>
					to one gone astray,<br/>
					hold up a shining light<br/>
					so that they who have eyes<br/>
					may see forms.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus has Dhamma been expounded<br/>
					by the worthy Ānanda<br/>
					in divers ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">I myself, worthy Ānanda,<br/>
					do go for refuge to the Buddha,<br/>
					to Dhamma,<br/>
					to the Order of Monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let master Ānanda accept me<br/>
					as a lay-follower<br/>
					from this day forth<br/>
					so long as life shall last<br/>
					as one who has so taken refuge.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying among the Sakyans<br/>
					near <a href="#11_kapilavatthu">Kapilavatthu,</a> in Banyan Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time<br/>
					the Exalted One was just recovered from sickness,<br/>
					not long recovered from sickness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Mahānāma the Sakyan<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#475_n1" id="fn1">1</a>]</sup></span> came to see the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him<br/>
					he saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br/>
					Mahānāma the Sakyan said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="475_pg199"><span class="f2 g"><b>[199]</b></span></a> &quot;For a long time, lord,<br/>
					I have known Dhamma which teaches thus: -</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Knowledge belongs to the man of composed mind,<br/>
					not to the restless-minded.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, lord, does concentration come first,<br/>
					then knowledge?</p>

					<p class="f4">Or does knowledge come first,<br/>
					then concentration?&quot;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Now it occurred to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Here is the Exalted One<br/>
					just recovered from sickness,<br/>
					quite lately recovered,<br/>
					and here is this Mahānāma the Sakyan<br/>
					asking him questions on a profound subject.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose I take him aside<br/>
					and acquaint him with Dhamma.&apos;&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">So the venerable Ānanda<br/>
					took Mahānāma the Sakyan by the arm,<br/>
					led him aside<br/>
					and said this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">3. &quot;Mahānāma, a learner&apos;s morality has been spoken of by the Exalted One,<br/>
					likewise an adept&apos;s morality.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way a learner&apos;s concentration<br/>
					and that of an adept<br/>
					have been spoken of by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Also the insight of a learner<br/>
					and that of an adept<br/>
					have been spoken of by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">4. Now what is<br/>
					the learner&apos;s morality?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#475_n2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Mahānāma, a monk is virtuous,<br/>
					restrained with the restraint of the obligations;<br/>
					proficient in following the practice of right conduct<br/>
					he sees danger in the slightest faults:<br/>
					he takes up and trains himself<br/>
					in the rules of morality.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br/>
					&apos;the learner&apos;s morality.&apos;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">5. And what, Mahānāma, is<br/>
					the learner&apos;s concentration?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein. Mahānāma, a monk,<br/>
					aloof from sense-desires,<br/>
					aloof from unprofitable states of mind,<br/>
					enters on the first musing<br/>
					which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					born of seclusion,<br/>
					zestful and easeful,<br/>
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by calming down thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					he enters on that inward calm,<br/>
					that single-minded purpose,<br/>
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					born of mental balance,<br/>
					zestful and easeful,<br/>
					which is the second musing,<br/>
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then by the fading out of zest<br/>
					he becomes balanced<br/>
					and remains mindful and composed,<br/>
					and experiences with the body<br/>
					that happiness of which the Ariyans aver:</p>

					<p class="f4">The balanced, thoughtful man lives happily,</p>

					<p class="f4">and he enters on the third musing<br/>
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by rejecting pleasure and pain alike,<br/>
					by the coming to an end<br/>
					of the joy and sorrow which he had before,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the fourth musing,<br/>
					free of pain and free of pleasure,<br/>
					a state of perfect purity<br/>
					of balance and equanimity.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br/>
					&apos;the learner&apos;s concentration.&apos;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">6. And what, Mahānāma, is<br/>
					the learner&apos;s insight?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Mahānāma, a monk understands,<br/>
					as it really is,</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;This is Ill&apos;.</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;This is the arising of Ill&apos;.</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;This is the making of Ill to cease&apos;.</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;This is the practice<br/>
					that leads to the ending of III&apos;.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br/>
					&apos;the learner&apos;s insight.&apos;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Mahānāma,<br/>
					that Ariyan disciple,<br/>
					thus equipped with morality,<br/>
					concentration<br/>
					and insight,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#475_n3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					by the destruction of the āsavas<br/>
					himself having come to know<br/>
					thoroughly in this very <a id="475_pg200"><span class="f2 g"><b>[200]</b></span></a> life<br/>
					the heart&apos;s release<br/>
					and the release by insight<br/>
					which is free from the āsavas,<br/>
					having attained it<br/>
					abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">(This is the state of the adept.)<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#475_n4" id="fn4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Mahānāma,<br/>
					a learner&apos;s morality<br/>
					has been spoken of by the Exalted One,<br/>
					an adept&apos;s morality<br/>
					has been spoken of by the Exalted One,<br/>
					a learner&apos;s concentration<br/>
					has been spoken of by the Exalted One,<br/>
					an adept&apos;s concentration<br/>
					has been spoken of by the Exalted One,<br/>
					a learner&apos;s insight<br/>
					has been spoken of by the Exalted One,<br/>

					<p class="f4">As they thus sat,<br/>
					Abhaya the Licchavī said this<br/>
					to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Sir, Nātha&apos;s son, the Unclothed,<br/>
					claims to be all-knowing,<br/>
					all-seeing,<br/>
					and to have all-comprising<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#481_n2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span> knowledge and vision.</p>

					<p class="f4">He says,</p>

					or sleep<br/>

							<p><i><b>he makes an end of former action which has affected him</b></i> is: <i>Purāṇañ ca kammaɱ phussa phussa vyantīkaroti.</i> And he removes past kamma by way of touch touch. Repeated contact. There is no explanation in the sutta, and the various translations do not explain well. The idea is that by continuously examining the body, sensations, mental states and the Dhamma and dredging up in memory deeds said and done in the past and examining them from the perspective of Dhamma as it is currently understood [the point of satipatthana, and an evolving process] one is in effect experiencing the consequences of one&apos;s past deeds. At this point by understanding the deed in terms of ethical conduct, the detachment of <i>jhāna</i> and by seeing the freedom in the destruction of the corrupting influences [<i>āsava</i>] the deed is resolved and swept away.<br/>
							Understanding this in this way one is able to resolve the paradox presented by the statement made that there is no ending of kamma without experiencing the results thereof, and the case of Arahants apparently being subjected to the consequences of prior bad kamma as in the cases of Devadatta being able to injure the Buddha&apos;s toe, Moggliana being murdered, and Angulimala being subjected to assalt.<br/>
							How?<br/>
							By ethical conduct, the calm detached serenity of <i>jhāna,</i> and insight into the freedom that results from the destruction of the corrupting influences of lust, hate, and stupidity [<i>āsavas</i>] it is possible to become arahant before the ending of kamma. The Arahant is, by this behavior and insight, subject to no further births after death. That is what distinguishes Arahantship in this life from pari-Nibbāna, and what is meant by the term &apos;with remainder&apos; when speaking of arahants and non-returners who must experience some delay after death before attaining Nibbāna. Those consequences of former deeds that remain to the Arahant, however far back in time they may have begun, are forced, because their scope is limited to the khandhas, (that is, the individuality,) into presenting themselves within the narrow limit of the life of the Arahant that remains. Thus they are experienced, but in proportion to the relationship of the finite life remaining to the unbounded scope of Nibbāna.  A similar thing occurs for the Streamwinner, Once-returner, and Non-returner.</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;In this way, Ānanda, action is the field, consciousness the seed, craving the moisture.</p>

					<p class="f4">For beings hindered by nescience, fettered by craving, intention is established, aspiration is established in a more excellent element.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus in the future<br/>
					there is repeated rebirth.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way, Ānanda, there is becoming.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat thus<br/>
					the Exalted One said this<br/>
					to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">Will every sort of moral practice,<br/>

					<p class="f4">So said the venerable Ānanda<br/>

					rose up from his seat,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Now not long after the venerable Ānanda was gone<br/>

					<p class="f4">Immeasurable are the Tathāgatas.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a third time the venerable Ānanda said:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;I will, lord,&quot; replied the venerable Ānanda<br/>

					who said:</p>

					<p class="f4">3. &quot;As far as moon and sun move in their course<br/>

					a thousand heavens of the Thirty-Three,<br/>
					a thousand Yama worlds,<br/>
					a thousand heavens of the Devas of Delight,<br/>
					a thousand heavens of the Devas that delight in creation,<br/>
					the same of those Devas that delight in others&apos; creations,<br/>
					and a thousand Brahma worlds.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Ānanda,<br/>
					is called:</p>

					<p class="f4">The system of the thousand lesser worlds.</p>

					<p class="f4">A system a thousandfold the size of this<br/>

					<p class="f4">The Twice-a-thousand Middling Thousandfold World-system.</p>

					<p class="f4">A system a thousandfold the size of this is called:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Thrice-a-thousand Mighty Thousandfold World-system.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Ānanda, if he wished it,<br/>
					the Tathāgata could make his voice heard<br/>
					throughout this last-named world-system,<br/>
					or<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#502_n9" id="fn9">9</a>]</sup></span> even further,<br/>
					if he chose.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">4. &quot;Pray, lord, how could that be done?</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;In this connexion, Ānanda,<br/>
					the Tathāgata suffuses with <a id="502_pg208"><span class="f2 g"><b>[208]</b></span></a> radiance the Thrice-a-thousand Mighty Thousandfold World-system.</p>

					<p class="f4">When its inhabitants perceive this,<br/>
					then the Tathāgata would give utterance<br/>
					and make the sound heard.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how he would do it.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">5. At these words the venerable Ānanda exclaimed to the venerable Udāyin:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#502_n10" id="fn10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;It is indeed a gain for me!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well gotten indeed by me it is<br/>
					that my teacher is of such mighty power and majesty!&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">Whereupon the venerable Udayin said to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;What is it to you, friend Ānanda,<br/>
					that your teacher should be of such mighty power and majesty?&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words the Exalted One said to the venerable Udayin:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Say not so, Udayin!</p>

					<p class="f4">Say not so, Udayin!</p>

					<p class="f4">If Ānanda were to make an end<br/>
					without attaining perfect freedom from passion,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#502_n11" id="fn11">11</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					yet by virtue of his heart of faith<br/>
					he would seven times win rule among the Devas,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Such an one<br/>
					by the destruction of the five fetters<br/>
					that bind to the lower worlds,<br/>
					takes birth spontaneously (in the Pure Abodes),<br/>
					there to pass away,<br/>
					destined never to return thence.</p>

					<p class="f4">5. Lastly, in this matter<br/>
					a monk keeps the laws of morality in full,<br/>

					he practises the acquiring of insight in full.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever minor, trifling observances<br/>

					<p class="f4">Such an one, by destroying the āsavas,<br/>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was going his rounds among the <a href="#11_kosala">Kosalans</a><br/>
					together with a great company of monks,<br/>
					and on coming to Pankadhā,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#550_n1" id="fn1">1</a>]</sup></span><br/>

					<p class="f4">(Now Pankadhā is a district of the Kosalans.)<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#550_n2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion<br/>
					a certain monk named Kassapa,<br/>
					of the Kassapa clan,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#550_n3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					was resident at Pankadhā,<br/>
					and it happened that the Exalted One was instructing,<br/>

					with a religious talk<br/>
					suitable to the keeping of the <a id="550_pg217"><span class="f2 g"><b>[217]</b></span></a> precepts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the monk Kassapa,<br/>
					while the Exalted One was tbus engaged,<br/>

					<p class="f4">This recluse is much too scrupulous.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#550_n4" id="fn4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">2. So the Exalted One,<br/>
					after staying at Pankadhā as long as he wished,<br/>
					set forth on his rounds towards <a href="#11_rajagaha">Rājagaha</a>,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Then the monk Kassapa<br/>

					not long after the departure of the Exalted One,<br/>

					<p class="f4">&quot;It is a loss to me!</p>

					I did not approve<br/>
					but was dissatisfied,<br/>
					and thought:<br/>
					&apos;This recluse is much too scrupulous&apos;.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose now I were to go to see the Exalted One,<br/>

					were to explain my transgression to him as such.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					and set off for Rājagaha<br/>
					and thence to where the Exalted One was staying<br/>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him<br/>
					he saluted him<br/>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br/>
					Kassapa the monk said this<br/>

					inciting<br/>
					and gladdening the monks<br/>
					with a religious talk<br/>
					suitable to the keeping of the precepts,<br/>
					did not approve,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One,<br/>

					suitable to the keeping of the precepts,<br/>
					I did not approve<br/>

					&quot;This recluse is much too scrupulous&quot;.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose now I were to go to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					were to explain my transgression to him as such.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="550_pg218"><span class="f2 g"><b>[218]</b></span></a> Transgression, lord, overcame me,<br/>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a href="#558_fn2" id="n2">2</a>]</sup> This does not controvert the doctrine of the deed, but means that the particular kind of action does not find its exact replica in fulfilment, because times and men and things are always changing.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a href="#558_fn5" id="n5">5</a>]</sup> Text should read <i>Nāṇum pi khāyati, bahu-d-eva (ne minimum quidem videtur, ne multum dicam),</i> which <i>Comy.</i> paraphrases thus: <i>dutiye attabhāve aṇum pi na khāyati: aṇumattam pi dutiye attabhāve vipākaɱ na deti,</i> &apos;in his next birth not a jot of it is seen: in his next birth it does not produce even a trifling result. Grimm follows this rendering <i>(loc. cit.)</i> which the Pali may bear, but it does not harmonize with the Gangā simile. Warren gives just the opposite meaning, translating &apos;not slight, but grievous.&apos;</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a href="#558_fn6" id="n6">6</a>]</sup> <i>Abhāvita.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a href="#558_fn7" id="n7">7</a>]</sup> <i>App&apos;ātumo</i> (&apos;a small ego&apos;). <i>Comy.</i> <i>ātumo vuccati aitabhāvo, tasmiɱ mahante pi (?) guṇa-parittatāya app&apos;ātumo yeva.</i> <i>Cf.</i> <i>Nid.</i> i, 69 <i>(ātumā vuccati attā).</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a href="#558_fn8" id="n8">8</a>]</sup> <i>Appa-dukkha-vihārī.</i> The words would ordinarily mean &apos;he lives in but little pain,&apos; but apparently it is contrasted with <i>appamāṇa-vihārī</i> below.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a href="#558_fn9" id="n9">9</a>]</sup> <i>Mahattā = mahātmā.</i> (<i>Comy.</i> avoids this &apos;soul&apos; or &apos;self&apos; idea by saying he is great by his great qualities, though his person be small (?), but in dealing with the next word, <i>appamāṇa-vihārī,</i> admits that he is Arahant.)</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a href="#558_fn10" id="n10">10</a>]</sup> <i>Kahāpaṇa</i> = ? a farthing. It may be a case of theft or debt; the comparison with the rich man suggests the latter alternative.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a href="#558_fn11" id="n11">11</a>]</sup> The conclusion is that one man is unable to pay off his karma, while the other can do so. The rich man is the one who has more ability and merit.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="#664_p1" id="p1">1</a>]</span> Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was going his rounds among the Kosalans and came to Kapilavatthu.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now Mahānāma the Sakyan<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#663_n1" id="fn1">1</a>]</sup></span> heard the news:</p>

					<p class="f4">They say the Exalted One has reached Kapilavatthu.</p>

					<p class="f4">So Mahānāma the Sakyan went to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him saluted him and stood at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus stood,<br/>
					the Exalted One said this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="663_pg255"><span class="f2 g"><b>[255]</b></span></a> &quot;Go you, Mahānāma, and find out some lodging<br/>
					where I may spend this one night.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Very well, lord,&quot; replied Mahānāma the Sakyan<br/>
					and went to Kapilavatthu;<br/>
					where, though he searched all through the town,<br/>
					he could not find a proper lodging for the Exalted One<br/>
					in which to spend that one night.</p>

					<p class="f4">So he returned to where the Exalted One was and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">2. &quot;Lord, there is no proper lodging<br/>
					wherein the Exalted One may spend this one night.</p>

					<p class="f4">But here is Bharaṇḍu the Kālāman,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#663_n2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					who was once a co-disciple in the holy life<br/>
					with the Exalted One.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#663_n3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Let the Exalted One spend this one night<br/>
					in his hermitage.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Go then, Mahānāma.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Spread a mat (for me there).&quot;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#663_n4" id="fn4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Very well, lord,&quot; replied Mahānāma the Sakyan<br/>
					and went off to the hermitage of Bharaṇḍu the Kālāman.</p>

					<p class="f4">On getting there he spread a mat,<br/>
					set water ready for feet-washing<br/>
					and returned to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Lord, the mat is spread.</p>

					<p class="f4">Water is set for feet-washing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the Exalted One do as he deems seasonable.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">3. So the Exalted One went to the hermitage of Bharaṇḍu the Kālāman.</p>

					<p class="f4">On arriving there he sat down on a seat made ready and so sitting had his feet washed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now this thought occurred to Mahānāma the Sakyan:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;It is unseasonable to wait upon the Exalted One now.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is weary.</p>

					<p class="f4">Tomorrow I will wait upon him.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">So saluting the Exalted One by the right he departed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now when the night was gone<br/>
					Mahānāma the Sakyan went to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him he saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus sat, the Exalted One said this to him:</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4">4. &quot;Mahānāma, there are these three teachers found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="663_pg256"><span class="f2 g"><b>[256]</b></span></a> Herein, Mahānāma, a teacher preaches full comprehension<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#663_n5" id="fn5">5</a>]</sup></span> of the sense-desires,<br/>
					but not of the objects of sense,<br/>
					nor of feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein again, Mahānāma, a certain teacher preaches full comprehension of sense-desires<br/>
					and of the objects of sense,<br/>
					but not of feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">While yet another teacher preaches the full comprehension<br/>
					of all three.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three teachers found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Now of these three, Mahānāma,<br/>
					is the conclusion one and the same<br/>
					or is it different?</p>

					<p class="f4">5. At these words Bharaṇḍu the Kālāman said to Mahānāma the Sakyan:</p>

					<p class="f4">Say it is one and the same, Mahānāma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whereat the Exalted One said to Mahānāma:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Say it is different,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#663_n6" id="fn6">6</a>]</sup></span> Mahānāma.&quot;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a second time Bharandu said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Say it is different, Mahānāma.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Say it is one and the same, Mahānāma.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">6. Then a third time Bharandu said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Say it is different, Mahānāma.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Say it is one and the same, Mahānāma.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Whereupon it occurred to Bharaṇḍu the Kālāman:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Here am I even to the third time<br/>
					slighted by Gotama the recluse<br/>
					in the presence of Mahānāma the Sakyan,<br/>
					a man of great importance.</p>

					<p class="f4">I had better leave Kapilavatthu.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">So Bharaṇḍu the Kālāman left Kapilavatthu,<br/>
					and in thus departing from Kapilavatthu<br/>
					he was gone for good<br/>
					and came not back any more.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#663_n7" id="fn7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

							<p>Here this departure is an act of inwardly re-directed anger (like suicide) at being made to face embarassment at being shown up in front of an important personage. The lesson here is to see how he was shown up — that is, this was not simply a case of his being contradicted three times and taking offense at an afront. Bharaṇḍu&apos;s reaction shows that he did not understand the significance of comprehension of the realationship between sense desires, forms and sensations. Holding the position that the result of understanding all three is the same is thinking that understanding sense desires includes understanding as well forms and sensations (that is, that the same desire to experience sensation from a given sense organ and sense object will always produce the same sensation). By aserting this position he is also claiming to understand the three. But if Bharaṇḍu had understood the <i>relative</i> relationship of sense desire, form, and sensation, he would have seen what Gotama was doing (which was showing him that the same sense desire and form combination was producing different sensations at each repetition) and he would have seen the error in his thinking and in spite of his embarassment, would not have felt anger, could have seen the value of the lesson (that any sense desire/form situation could give rise to three different sorts of sensation depending on one&apos;s point of view) and could have become a disciple of Gotama.<br/>

					<p class="f4">My body is calmed, not perturbed.</p>

					<p class="f4">My mind is collected, one-pointed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet for all that<br/>
					my heart is not released from the āsavas<br/>

					<p class="f4">2. &quot;Well, Anuruddha,<br/>
					as to your statement about seeing the thousandfold world-system,<br/>
					that is just your conceit.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#684_n2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">As to your statement about being strenuous and unshaken <a id="684_pg261"><span class="f2 g"><b>[261]</b></span></a> and so forth,<br/>
					- that is just arrogance.</p>

					<p class="f4">It would indeed be well for the venerable Anuruddha<br/>

					paid no attention to them,<br/>
					but focussed his mind on the deathless element.</p>

					<p class="f4">And it came to pass that the venerable Anuruddha,<br/>
					living alone, secluded, earnest, ardent and aspiring,<br/>
					in no long time attained the goal supreme of the holy life,<br/>
					for which clansmen rightly go forth from home to the homeless:<br/>
					even in this very life he himself by his own intuitional powers realized it,<br/>
