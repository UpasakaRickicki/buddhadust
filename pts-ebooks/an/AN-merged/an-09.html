The field is the Buddha&apos;s message; the harvester is the striver; the sickle is insight; the cutting time is reflection time; the stick is reflection on foul things; the fence is restraint; the cattle breaking in is the rising of passion; their ejection and his return to work is the destruction of passion and his return to reflection.</p>

					to put away ill-will;<br/>

					at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika&apos;s Park,<br/>
					the venerable Nandaka<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#52_n1" id="fn1">1</a>]</sup></span> gave Dhamma discourse to the monks in the service hall;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#52_n2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					taught them,<br/>
					roused them,<br/>
					incited them<br/>
					and gladdened them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now in the evening<br/>
					the Exalted One rose from seclusion<br/>
					and approached the service hall;<br/>
					and having come,<br/>
					he stood outside the doorway,<br/>
					waiting for the discourse to end.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he knew that the discourse was ended,<br/>

					<p class="f4">When he had seated himself,<br/>
					the Exalted One spoke thus to the venerable Nandaka:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Surely, Nandaka, this Dhamma discourse,<br/>
					which you preached to the monks,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Had we known, lord, we would not have said so much.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">Once, when the Exalted One was staying near Rājagaha, on Mount Vulture Peak, Sajjha, the wanderer, came and paid him a visit.</p>

					I heard this from the mouth of the Exalted One,<br/>
					from his own mouth I learnt it:</p>

					<p class="f4">Both in the past and now,<br/>
					I, verily, declare:</p>

					<p class="f4">The arahant monk, who has destroyed the cankers,<br/>

							<p class="f2"><i>Dh.S.: A Buddhist Manual of Psychological Ethics,</i> C.A.F. Rhys Davids, trans.: <b>§7:</b> What on that occasion is application of mind <i>(vitakko)</i>? The discrimination, the application, which on that occsion is the disposing, the fixing, the focussing, the superposing of the mind, right disposing - this is the application that there then is. fn: <i>Vitakko</i> and <i>vicāro</i> is a pair of terms which it is hard to fit with any one pair of English words. It is very possible that academic teaching came to attach a more pregnant and specialized import to them than was conveyed in popular and purely ethical usage. <i>Cf.</i> <i>M.</i> i, Suttas <a href="#177_p19">xix</a> and <a href="#177_p20">xx,</a> where <i>vitakkā</i> would be adequately rendered by ideas, notions, or thoughts. In <i>Asl.</i> 114, 115, on the other hand (<i>cf.</i> <i>Mil.</i> 62, 63), the relation of the two to <i>cittaɱ</i> and to each other is set out with much metaphor, if with too little psychological grasp. <i>Vitakko</i> is destinctively mental procedure at the inception of a train of thought, the deliberate movement of voluntary attention. As king ascends to his palace leaning on the arm of favourite or relative, so mind, or consciousness, ascends to its object depending upon the apprehensive act (<i>vitakko;</i> <i>As.</i> 114). Other metaphorical attributes are its impingeing upon, circum-impingeing upon <i>(paryāhanaɱ),</i> the object, and, again, bringing it near. Hence in selecting &quot;application&quot; in preference to &quot;reasoning&quot;, by which <i>vitakko</i> has often been translated, I wished to bring out this graspoing, apprehending, reaching-out act of the mind, this incipient fetch of the consciousness elaborated in the Buddhist scholastic analysis of the term. Yet, just as applied thinking may include &quot;reasoning&quot; or &quot;ratiocination&quot;, so <i>vitakko</i> is, in the reply, described by <i>takko,</i> the term used for ratiocinative procedure, argument, or logic (<i>cf.</i> <i>D.</i> i, <a href="#178_p12">12,</a> <a href="#178_p21">21</a>). &quot;What,&quot; asks the <i>Cy.,</i> &quot;does one reason about <i>(takkesi)?</i> About a pot, a cart, the distance of anything. Well, <i>vitakko</i> is a stronger reasoning.&quot;</p>
							
							<p class="f2"><i>Vicāro,</i> as compared with <i>vitakko,</i> was used to express the movement and maintenance of the voluntary thought-continuum, as distinguished from the initiative grappling with the subject of reflection. Examining in detail, as compared with grasping the whole, is also read into it by commentators (<i>Asl.</i> 114). It is a pounding up <i>(anumajjanaɱ),</i> as well as a linking together. Metaphors are multiplied, to show its relation to vitakko. It is as the reverberation of the beaten drum or bell is to the beating; as the planing movement of the bird&apos;s wings after the initial uspsoaring; as the buzzing of the bee when it has alighted on the lotus; as the scouring of the dirty bowl when clutched; as the manipulating hand of the potter, <i>vitakko</i> being represented by the hand which holds the clay to the wheel, and so on. &quot;Investigation&quot; would well represent the sustained activity; &quot;analysis&quot; the cogitation in details; &quot;discursive thought&quot; gives some of the import of both.</p>
							
							<p class="f2">and</p>
							
							<p class="f2"><b>§21:</b> What on that occasion is right intention <i>(sammā-sankappo)?</i> The answer is as for §7 <i>Vitakko.</i> fn: <i>Sankappo</i> is by the <i>Cy.</i> especially identified with the expression <i>cetaso abhiniropanā,</i> superposing of the mind, the disposition or adjustment of attention, that on which the heart is set, hence aspiration, intention, purpose, design. In <a href="#139_pg27"><i>M.</i> ii, 27 f.,</a> it is said to arise out of <i>saññā</i> (perception).</p>

					he called the venerable Ānanda and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Prithee wait here, Ānanda,<br/>
					while I am gone into Mahavana for the midday rest.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Yes, lord,&quot; he rejoined;<br/>
					and the Exalted One entered Mahavana for the midday rest<br/>
					and sat down at the foot of a tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the goodman, Tapussa, visited the venerable Ānanda,<br/>
					saluted him and sat down at one side;<br/>
					and so seated, he said thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;We householders, reverend Ānanda,<br/>
					are pleasure-seekers,<br/>
					pleasure-fond,<br/>
					pleasure-doting,<br/>
					pleasure-mad<br/>
					and, being so,<br/>
					it seems a real precipice to us,<br/>
					this giving up of all;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#367_n3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					yet I&apos;ve heard, reverend sir,<br/>
					that in this Dhamma-discipline<br/>
					the heart of every young monk<br/>
					leaps up at this giving up,<br/>
					becomes <a id="367_pg294"><span class="f2 g"><b>[294]</b></span></a> calm, steadfast and inclined<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#367_n4" id="fn4">4</a>]</sup></span> thereto,<br/>
					seeing it is the peace.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#367_n5" id="fn5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">And just there, reverend sir,<br/>
					is the difference in this Dhamma-discipline<br/>
					&apos;twixt monk and the many folk,<br/>
					I mean in this giving up.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;This, indeed, is a topic for a talk, goodman!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Let us go and see the Exalted One;<br/>
					we will visit him<br/>
					and tell him the matter,<br/>
					and as the Exalted One explains,<br/>
					so we will bear it in mind.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">Very well, sir,<br/>
					replied the goodman to the venerable Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Ānanda went<br/>
					with the goodman, Tapussa,<br/>
					and visited the Exalted One,<br/>
					saluted and sat down at one side;<br/>
					and the venerable Ānanda told the Exalted One all the goodman had said ...</p>
					
					<p class="f4">&quot;It is verily so, Ānanda,<br/>
					it is verily so!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When I was but a being awakening, Ānanda,<br/>
					and not wholly awakened,<br/>
					ere there was full awakenment,<br/>
					I thought thus:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">&apos;Good is the giving up of all;<br/>
					good it is to go apart<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#367_n6" id="fn6">6</a>]</sup></span> —<br/>
					but my mind leapt not up,<br/>
					became not calm,<br/>
					steadfast,<br/>
					nor inclined to this giving up<br/>
					though I saw:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">&quot;It is the peace.&quot;&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">And I thought:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">&apos;Now what&apos;s the cause, the reason <i>my mind leaps not up,<br/>
					becomes not calm,<br/>
					steadfast,<br/>
					nor inclined to this giving up<br/>
					though I saw:</i></p>
					
					<p class="f4"><i>&quot;It is the peace.&quot;&apos;?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Then I thought:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">&apos;The peril of pleasures is not seen by me,<br/>
					its not made much of by me;<br/>
					the advantage of this giving up<br/>
					is not won,<br/>
					is not enjoyed<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#367_n7" id="fn7">7</a>]</sup></span> by me;<br/>
					so my mind leaps not up,<br/>
					becomes calm,<br/>
					steadfast,<br/>
					nor inclined to this giving up<br/>
					though I see it is the peace.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">And I thought:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">&apos;If, seeing the peril of pleasures,<br/>
					I were to make much of it;<br/>
					if, winning the advantage of this giving up,<br/>
					I were to enjoy it;<br/>
					it would surely happen<br/>
					that my mind would leap up,<br/>
					become calm,<br/>
					steadfast<br/>
					and inclined to this giving up<br/>
					on seeing it to be the peace.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">And presently, Ānanda,<br/>
					on seeing the peril<br/>
					I made much <a id="367_pg295"><span class="f2 g"><b>[295]</b></span></a> of it;<br/>
					on winning the advantage<br/>
					I enjoyed it;<br/>
					and my mind leapt up,<br/>
					became calm,<br/>
					steadfast<br/>
					and inclined to this giving up<br/>
					on seeing it was the peace.</p>

					<p class="f4">And presently, Ānanda,<br/>
					aloof from sense desires,<br/>
					<i>aloof from evil ideas,</i><br/>
					I entered and abode in the first musing;<br/>
					but as I abode in this abiding,<br/>
					thoughts and distractions<br/>
					of a sensuous kind beset me;<br/>
					and it was for me a disease.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Just as some ill,<br/>
					amounting to a disease,<br/>
					might arise in some happy person, Ānanda,<br/>
					even so such thoughts and distractions<br/>
					of a sensuous kind beset me<br/>
					and it was for me a disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I thought:</p>
				
					
					<p class="f4">&apos;Now what&apos;s the cause,<br/>
					the reason my mind leaps not up,<br/>
					becomes not calm,<br/>
					steadfast,<br/>
					nor inclined to this giving up of thoughts and distractions<br/>
					of a sensuous kind,<br/>
					though I saw:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">&quot;It is the peace.&quot;&apos;?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then I thought:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What if I were to suppress applied and sustained thought ... and enter and abide in the second musing ... the third ... the fourth musing ... the sphere of infinite space ... of infinite consciousness ... of nothingness ... of neither perception nor non-perception<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#367_n8" id="fn8">8</a>]</sup></span> ... in theending of perception and feeling?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And presently, Ānanda,<br/>
					passing wholly beyond the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception,<br/>
					I entered and abode in the ending of perception and feeling<br/>
					and I saw by wisdom<br/>
					that the cankers were completely destroyed.</p>

					<p class="f4">And so long, Ānanda,<br/>
					as I attained not to,<br/>
					emerged not from<br/>
					these nine attainments of gradual abidings,<br/>
					both forwards and backwards,<br/>
					I realized not completely,<br/>
					as one wholly awakened,<br/>
					the full perfect awakening,<br/>
					unsurpassed in the world<br/>
					with its gods,<br/>
					Maras and Brahmas,<br/>
					on earth with its recluses,<br/>
					godly men,<br/>
					devas and men;<br/>
					but when I attained to<br/>
					and emerged from<br/>
					these abidings,<br/>
					both forwards and backwards,<br/>
					then, wholly awakened,<br/>
					I realized completely<br/>
					the full perfect awakening<br/>
					unsurpassed in the world<br/>
					with its gods,<br/>
					Maras and Brahmas,<br/>
					on earth with its recluses,<br/>
					godly men,<br/>
					devas and men.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then knowledge and vision<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#367_n9" id="fn9">9</a>]</sup></span> rose up within me:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">&apos;Mind&apos;s release for me is unshakable,<br/>
					this birth is final,<br/>
					there is now no becoming again.&apos;&quot;</p>
