					and of the clansman, who has laid aside sickle and pingo<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#45_n2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					and gone forth from the home to the homeless life, it is right to say:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">By faith has the clansman gone forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Pleasures, monks, are gotten in youth;<br/>
					yea, those of all kinds.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, monks, low pleasures and the middling sort and those that are high-pitched,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#45_n3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span><br/>

					with what utmost haste would she at once attend to the matter and quickly remove it.<br/>
					And if she could not get at it at once she would clasp him round the <a id="45_pg5"><span class="f2 g"><b>[5]</b></span></a> head with her left hand,<br/>
					and with her right, crooking her finger, fetch it out, even though she drew blood.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And why?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Monks, such a thing is a danger to the child;<br/>
					it is not harmless, I say.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, monks, such an act ought to be done by the nurse out of love,<br/>
					seeking the child&apos;s good,<br/>
					from pity and compassion.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when that boy is older and sensible,<br/>
					then, monks, she no longer looks after him, knowing:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">&quot;The lad is now self-warded,<br/>
					has done with remissness.&quot;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">In just the same way, monks, so long as right things are not done by a monk by faith, conscientiousness, fear of blame, energy and insight,<br/>

					but when right things are so done,<br/>

					&quot;The monk is now self-warded,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#45_n5" id="fn5">5</a>]</sup></span> has done with remissness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One<br/>
					with a great company of monks,<br/>

					came to the brahman village of Icchānangala<br/>
					belonging to them.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One dwelt in the Icchānangala woodland thicket.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the brāhman householders of Icchānangala heard of this.</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Mark you,&apos; they said,<br/>
					the recluse, Master Gotama, the Sakya,<br/>
					gone forth from the Sakyan clan,<br/>
					has come to Icchānangala<br/>
					and dwells in our wood near by;<br/>
					and of this same Master <a id="192_pg22"><span class="f2 g"><b>[22]</b></span></a> Gotama<br/>
					this excellent report goes abroad:</p>

					<p class="f4">He is the Exalted One,<br/>
					arahant,<br/>
					perfectly enlightened,<br/>
					endowed with wisdom and righteousness,<br/>
					one well-gone,<br/>
					a world-knower,<br/>
					the unsurpassed,<br/>
					a tamer of tamable men,<br/>
					a teacher,<br/>
					a Buddha of devas and men,<br/>
					the Exalted One!</p>

					<p class="f4">Having realized more-knowledge himself,<br/>
					he declares it to this world<br/>
					with its devas<br/>
					and Māras<br/>
					and Brahmas,<br/>
					to this earth with its recluses and brahmans,<br/>
					its devas and men;<br/>
					and he teaches Dhamma,<br/>
					lovely in the beginning,<br/>
					lovely in.the middle<br/>
					and lovely in the end;<br/>
					and sets forth the godly life,<br/>
					utterly pure and perfect,<br/>
					both in spirit and letter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well indeed is it to see such arahants!&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">And when the night was over,<br/>
					they went to the wood,<br/>
					taking with them a great deal of hard and soft food,<br/>
					and stood outside the entrance,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#192_n1" id="fn1">1</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					making a great din and uproar.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Nāgita<br/>
					was the Exalted One&apos;s personal attendant.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One called to the venerable Nāgita and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Who are these, Nāgita, that make this great din and uproar?</p>

					<p class="f4">Like fisherfolk, methinks,<br/>
					with a great haul of fish!&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;These men, lord, are the brahman householders of Icchānangala,<br/>
					who wait outside the gateway.</p>

					<p class="f4">They have brought much hard and soft food<br/>
					for the Exalted One and for the Order.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;I have naught to do with homage, Nāgita,<br/>
					nor has homage aught to do with me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whosoever cannot obtain at will,<br/>
					easily and without difficulty<br/>
					this happiness of renunciation,<br/>
					this happiness of seclusion,<br/>
					this happiness of calm<br/>
					and this happiness of enlightenment,<br/>
					which I can obtain at will,<br/>
					easily and without difficulty,<br/>
					let him enjoy that dung-like happiness,<br/>
					that sluggish happiness,<br/>
					that happiness gotten of<br/>
					gains,<br/>
					favours<br/>
					and flattery.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Lord, let the Exalted One accept (their offerings)!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the Well-gone accept;<br/>
					now, lord,<br/>
					is the time for the Blessed One to accept!</p>

					<p class="f4">For wheresoever henceforth the Exalted One shall go,<br/>
					the brahman householders of town and country<br/>
					will be just as inclined (to give).</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, just as when the (rain-) deva <a id="192_pg23"><span class="f2 g"><b>[23]</b></span></a> rains big drops,<br/>
					the water flows with the incline;<br/>
					even so, lord,<br/>
					wheresoever the Exalted One shall henceforth go,<br/>
					the brahman householders of town and country<br/>
					wil1 be inclined.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, it is because of the virtue and wisdom of the Edited One.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Nāgita, I have naught to do with homage,<br/>
					nor has homage aught to dö with me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whosoever cannot obtain at will,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near <a href="#11_savatthi">Sāvatthī,</a><br/>
					at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika&apos;s Park;<br/>
					and there Sumanā,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#203_n1" id="fn1">1</a>]</sup></span> the rajah&apos;s daughter,<br/>
					with a following of five hundred royal maidens<br/>
					in five hundred chariots,<br/>
					came and visited him; and,<br/>
					after saluting,<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, she spoke thus to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Lord, suppose two of the Blessed One&apos;s disciples<br/>
					were alike in faith,<br/>
					alike in virtue<br/>
					and alike in insight,<br/>
					but one was an alms-giver<br/>

					<p class="f4">Both, on the breaking up of the body after death,<br/>

					<p class="f4">There would be, Sumanā,<br/>

					<p class="f4">In these five ways, Sumanā,<br/>
					the alms-giver,<br/>
					when come to deva-state,<br/>
					surpasses the non-giver.&apos;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;But if, lord,<br/>
					faring on thence,<br/>
					they should return to this state here;<br/>
					when become human, lord,<br/>
					would there be a distinction,<br/>
					a difference,<br/>
					between them?&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">There would be, Sumanā,<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;The alms-giver,<br/>

					when gone forth, lord,<br/>

					often to accept a lodging,<br/>
					not rarely;<br/>
					often to accept medicaments for sickness,<br/>
					not rarely;<br/>
					with whomsoever he dwells<br/>
					in leading the godly life,<br/>
					such folk mostly act towards him with cordiality<br/>
					in their ways of living,<br/>

					seldom without cordiality.</p>

					<p class="f4">In these five ways, Sumanā,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;But, lord, if both win arahantship;<br/>
					in that state<br/>
					would there be a distinction,<br/>

					<p class="f4">&apos;In that case, Sumanā, I verily declare<br/>
					there is no difference whatsoever,<br/>
					that is to say,<br/>
					comparing emancipation<br/>
					with emancipation.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;It is amazing, lord,<br/>
					it is wonderful, lord,<br/>
					how far-reaching is the effect of giving alms<br/>
					and doing good deeds,<br/>
					since they are a help<br/>
					and a boon to one<br/>
					as a deva,<br/>
					a help and a boon to one<br/>
					as a man,<br/>
					yea, a help and a boon<br/>
					when one has gone forth!&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;It is even so, Sumanā,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#203_n5" id="fn5">51</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					far-reaching is the effect of giving alms<br/>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One;<br/>
					and when the Well-gone had thus spoken,<br/>
					the Master spoke again and said:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">&apos;As<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#203_n6" id="fn6">6</a>]</sup></span> stainless on her sky-bound course, the moon<br/>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near <a href="#11_bhaddiya">Bhaddiya</a><br/>

					and there Uggaha, Meṇḍaka&apos;s grandson,<br/>
					paid him a visit and,<br/>
					after saluting,<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Lord, let the Exalted One accept a meal at my house tomorrow,<br/>
					he as fourth (with us three).&apos;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#226_n2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="226_pg29"><span class="f2 g"><b>[29]</b></span></a> The Exalted One accepted by his silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Uggaha, Meṇḍaka&apos;s grandson,<br/>
					seeing the Exalted One had accepted,<br/>
					rose from his seat,<br/>
					saluted,<br/>
					and took his leave;<br/>
					keeping the Exalted One on his right.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now when the night was over,<br/>
					the Exalted One, robing himself in the morning,<br/>
					took bowl and cloak<br/>
					and went to Uggaha&apos;s house,<br/>
					and there sat down on the seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Uggaha, Meṇḍaka&apos;s grandson,<br/>
					served and satisfied the Exalted One by hand<br/>
					with plenty of hard and soft food<br/>
					and when the Exalted One had removed his hand from his bowl,<br/>
					he sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus seated, he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Lord, these girls of mine<br/>
					will be going to their husbands&apos; families;<br/>
					lord, let the Exalted One counsel them,<br/>
					let the Exalted One advise them,<br/>
					for their good and happiness<br/>
					for many a day!&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One spoke to them and said:</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#226_n3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span>Wherefore, girls, train yourselves in this way:</p>

					<p class="f4">To whatsoever husband our parents shall give us —<br/>

					order all things sweetly<br/>
					and be gentle voiced.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#226_n4" id="fn4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Train yourselves thus, girls.</p>

					<p class="f4">And in this way also, girls:</p>

					<p class="f4">We will honour,<br/>
					revere,<br/>
					esteem<br/>
					and respect<br/>
					all whom our husband reveres,<br/>
					whether mother or father,<br/>
					recluse or godly man,<br/>
					and on their arrival<br/>
					will offer them a seat and water.</p>

					<p class="f4">Train yourselves thus, girls.</p>

					<p class="f4">And in this way also, girls:</p>

					<p class="f4">We will be deft and nimble<br/>
					at our husband&apos;s home-crafts,<br/>
					whether they be of wool or <a id="226_pg30"><span class="f2 g"><b>[30]</b></span></a> cotton,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#226_n5" id="fn5">5</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					making it our business to understand the work,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Train yourselves thus, girls.</p>

					<p class="f4">And in this way also, girls:</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever our husband&apos;s household consist of —<br/>
					slaves, messengers and workfolk —<br/>
					we will know the work of each<br/>
					by what has been done,<br/>
					their remissness<br/>
					by what has not been done;<br/>
					we will know the strength and the weakness of the sick;<br/>
					we will divide the hard and soft food,<br/>
					each<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#226_n6" id="fn6">6</a>]</sup></span> according to his share.</p>

					<p class="f4">Train yourselves thus, girls.</p>

					<p class="f4">And in this way also, girls:</p>

					<p class="f4">The money,<br/>
					corn,<br/>
					silver<br/>
					and gold<br/>
					that our husband brings home,<br/>
					we will keep safe watch and ward over it,<br/>
					and act as no robber,<br/>
					thief,<br/>
					carouser,<br/>
					wastrel<br/>
					therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Train yourselves thus, girls.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, girls,<br/>
					possessed of these five qualities,<br/>
					women, on the breaking up of the body after death,<br/>
					are reborn among the devas of lovely form.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Active,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#226_n7" id="fn7">7</a>]</sup></span> alert to cherish him alway,<br/>
							Not to that man who brings<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#226_n8" id="fn8">8</a>]</sup></span> her every joy<br/>
							She offers slight; nor will a good wife<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#226_n9" id="fn9">9</a>]</sup></span> move<br/>
							To wrath her husband by some spiteful word;<br/>
							And she reveres all whom her husband honours,<br/>

							She minds his wealth amid his folk<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#226_n10" id="fn10">10</a>]</sup></span> at work<br/>
							And sweetly orders all. A wife like this,<br/>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a href="#226_fn1" id="n1">1</a>]</sup> Mendaka (the ram) was a fabulously rich man with magic powers, which his household were also supposed to possess (see <i>Vin.</i> i, 240; Warren, <a href="#229_"><i>B. in T.</i> 448</a>); he fed the B. and Order on a journey, after which travelling rations were allowed. Reference is made to him and his family at <i>Vism. trsl.</i> 443 (see note 1, p. 444; the stories, with less exaggeration, are told at <i>Vin. loc. cit.</i>); <i>UdA.</i> 158; <i>DhpA.:</i> <i>Visākhāyā vatthu</i> (<a href="#230_">Warren, op. cit., 451</a>).

The family lived at <a href="#11_bhaddiya">Bhaddiya</a> (our <i>Comy.</i> <i>-ike</i>) — according to Warren, in Bengal, but probably Magadha, since Bimbisāra sent his minister to witness M.&apos;s magic (<i>Vin.</i>). I cannot trace Uggaha elsewhere, our  <i>Comy.</i> is silent. Of Jātiyāvana, <i>Comy.</i> observes that the forest was one continuous stretch up the slope of the Himālayas.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a href="#226_fn2" id="n2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Atta-catuttho;</i> <i>Cf.</i> <a href="#48_pg393"><i>M.</i> I, 393,</a>  <i>Comy.</i>  says he did so fearing his girls would be nervous <i>(olīnamānā)</i> among the monks and not able to take in the Buddha&apos;s words.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a href="#226_fn4" id="n4">4</a>]</sup> At <a href="#232_pg175"><i>D.</i> ii, 175</a> these terms are applied to the ideal woman, <i>itthiratana;</i> at <a href="#157_pg60">D. i, 60,</a> [<a href="#171_p35">DN 17 § 35</a>] <a href="#233_pg84"><i>M.</i> ii, 84,</a> [<a href="#234_pg274">MN 84</a>] <a href="#235_PG113"><i>S.</i> iii, 113</a> [<a href="#236_p85">SN.22.85</a>] to a servant or a slave; see <i>D.A.</i> i, 168. <i>Cf.</i> <i>Brihaspati Smriti,</i> xxiv, 6 (<i>S.B.E.</i> xxxiii, 368); &apos;Rising before others, paying reverence to the elders of the family, preparing food and condiments and using a low seat and bed — thus have the duties of women been declared.&apos; Also <i>Proverbs</i> xxxi: &apos;She riseth while it is yet night ... she seeketh wool and flax and worketh willingly with her hands ... she looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.&apos;</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a href="#226_fn5" id="n5">5</a>]</sup> Of the former <i>Comy.</i> observes: Combing, washing, dyeing, plaiting, working, etc., goat&apos;s hair; of the latter: ginning <i>(vaṭṭana); piñjana,</i> ?carding, lit.: painting, in <i>Sk.</i> also to bleach; <i>phoṭana,</i> ? spinning, lit. either to boil or shake; <i>kantana,</i> weaving, more generally spinning.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a href="#226_fn6" id="n6">6</a>]</sup> <i>Comy.</i> with <i>v.l.</i> reads <i>c&apos;assa,</i> as at <i>A.</i> iv.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="#361_p1" id="p1">1</a>][<a href="#362_p1">bodh</a>]</span> Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">One time the venerable Nārada<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#360_n1" id="fn1">1</a>]</sup></span> dwelt near Pāṭaliputta,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#360_n2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					in the Cock&apos;s Park.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#360_n3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time Bhaddā, the dear and beloved ranee of rajah Muṇḍa,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#360_n4" id="fn4">4</a>]</sup></span> died;<br/>
					and because of the loss of his dear ranee, Bhaddā,<br/>
					he neither bathed,<br/>
					nor anointed himself,<br/>
					nor partook of any food,<br/>
					nor concerned himself with any affairs,<br/>
					but day and night<br/>
					clung in grief to her body<br/>
					as though a-swoon.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">After a while he summoned his treasurer, Piyaka,<br/>
					and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Prythee, friend Piyaka,<br/>
					place the body of the ranee, Bhaddā,<br/>
					in an oil vessel made of iron<br/>
					and cover it over with another iron vessel,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#360_n5" id="fn5">5</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					so that we shall see her body longer.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Yes, sire,&apos; Hyaka replied,<br/>
					and he placed the body of the ranee, Bhaddā,<br/>
					in an oil vessel made of iron<br/>
					and covered it over with another iron vessel.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Now Piyaka, the treasurer, thought to himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhaddā,<br/>
					the dear, beloved ranee of rajah Muṇḍa, is dead;<br/>
					and because of this <a id="360_pg49"><span class="f2 g"><b>[49]</b></span></a> loss,<br/>
					the rajah not even bathes<br/>
					or anoints himself,<br/>
					nor eats food,<br/>
					nor concerns himself with his affairs,<br/>
					but clings in grief to her body<br/>
					as though a-swoon.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#360_n6" id="fn6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What if rajah Muṇḍa go<br/>
					and wait upon some recluse or godly man!</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had learnt Dhamma,<br/>
					he would pluck out the dart of sorrow.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And again he thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Near Pāṭaliputta,<br/>
					in the Cock&apos;s Park,<br/>
					dwells this venerable Nārada;<br/>
					and of that same reverend sir<br/>
					this fair report is gone abroad:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;A sage is he,<br/>
					accomplished,<br/>
					wise,<br/>
					learned,<br/>
					an able speaker,<br/>
					of ready, gracious wit,<br/>
					both venerable<br/>
					and arahant.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#360_n7" id="fn7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Methinks, if rajah Muṇḍa were to go and wait upon the venerable Nārada,<br/>
					perhaps, after listening to the venerable one&apos;s Dhamma,<br/>
					he would pluck out the dart of sorrow.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">So Piyaka, the treasurer,<br/>
					approached the rajah and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Sire, this venerable Nārada dwells hard by Pāṭaliputta,<br/>
					in the Cock&apos;s Park;<br/>
					now of him a fair report has gone abroad,<br/>
					that he is a sage,<br/>
					accomplished,<br/>
					wise,<br/>
					learned,<br/>
					an able speaker,<br/>
					of ready, gracious wit,<br/>
					both venerable<br/>
					and arahant.</p>

					<p class="f4">Maybe, if my lord were to go and wait upon the venerable one,<br/>
					he could,<br/>
					after listening to the venerable Nārada&apos;s Dhamma,<br/>
					pluck out the dart of sorrow.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Very well, friend Piyaka,<br/>
					announce (my coming) to the venerable Nārada.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">And he thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">How, I wonder,<br/>
					ought one like me<br/>
					to approach a recluse or godly man,<br/>
					previously unknown,<br/>
					dwelling in the kingdom?</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Yes, sire,&apos; he replied;<br/>
					and Piyaka, the treasurer,<br/>
					went and visited the venerable Nārada<br/>
					and saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated,<br/>
					he spoke thus to the venerable one:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Reverend sir, Bhaddā, the dear and beloved ranee of rajah has died;<br/>
					and because of his loss<br/>
					the rajah neither bathes<br/>
					nor anoints himself,<br/>
					,<br/>
					nor eats food,<br/>
					nor concerns himself with his affairs,<br/>
					but <a id="360_pg50"><span class="f2 g"><b>[50]</b></span></a> clings in grief to her body<br/>
					as though a-swoon.</p>

					<p class="f4">Good it were, reverend sir,<br/>
					if the venerable Nārada were to teach such Dhamma<br/>
					that rajah Muṇḍa, having heard,<br/>
					might pluck out the dart of sorrow.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Now is the time, Piyaka,<br/>
					for the rajah Muṇḍa to do as he thinks fit.&apos;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Piyaka, the treasurer, got up from his seat,<br/>
					saluted the venerable Nārada<br/>
					and took his leave,<br/>
					keeping the venerable one on his right;<br/>
					and approaching the rajah,<br/>
					he said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Sire, I have made occasion with the venefable Nārada;<br/>
					sire, now is the time to do as you think fit.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Then, friend Piyaka,<br/>
					have our state carriages got ready.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Yes, sire,&apos; he replied;<br/>
					and when he had done so,<br/>
					he told the rajah:</p>

					<p class="f4">Sire, the state carriages await you.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then rajah Muṇḍa got up into a state carriage<br/>
					and with many others<br/>
					went off in royal pomp and power<br/>
					to see the venerable Nārada<br/>
					at the Cock&apos;s Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And having gone by carriage as far as the ground allowed,<br/>
					he got down and entered the Park on foot.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#360_n8" id="fn8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And the rajah Muṇḍa approached the venerable Nārada,<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side;<br/>
					and the venerable Nārada spoke thus to him,<br/>
					so seated:</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p class="f4">And early one morning,<br/>

					and entered Veaālī for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">And having gone his round,<br/>
					on his return,<br/>
					after the midday meal,<br/>
					he made his way into the great forest of Mahāvana,<br/>
					and sat down for the noonday rest<br/>
					at the foot of a tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time a company, of Lacchavi young men<br/>
					were out stalking and ranging in Mahāvana;<br/>
					they had their bows strung<br/>
					and were surrounded by a pack of dogs;<br/>
					and they saw the Exalted One<br/>
					seated at the foot of the tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then at that sight<br/>
					they cast aside their bows,<br/>
					called off their dogs<br/>
					and approached the Exalted One,<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and stood with hands upraised<br/>
					in silence reverencing him.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Mahānāma, the Licchavi,<br/>
					went to the Exalted One,<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he salid with bated breath:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#425_n2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;They will become Vajjians!&quot;?&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Lord, these Licchavi young men<br/>
					are quick-tempered,<br/>
					rough,<br/>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a href="#425_fn1" id="n1">1</a>]</sup> We are not able to link up this Mahānāma with others of that name, either, <i>e.g.</i> with him of the first five disciples, or the Sakyan lay-kinsman. It is possible that we have a name substituted, when <i>written</i> suttas involved many blurred words, for the forgotten name of a disciple. Rhys Davids lists Licchavis and Videhas as forming two branches of one Vajjian confederacy, but this sutta points to Licchavis as <i>not</i> Vajjians, a more cultured oligarchy. <i>Cf.</i> <a href="#88_pg79"><i>Dial.</i> ii, p. 79ff.;</a> <a href="#428_"><i>Buddh.

The Buddha testifies to having realized it under the Bodhi-Thee, but uses the kindred, less specialized word <i>ñāṇa.</i> In the mouth of bhikkhus such testifying was no guarantee of right <i>(sammā)</i> gnosis; it might be made through mental illusion, conceit, frenzy, or even evil design <a href="#6_p93">(<i>Aŋguttara</i> iii., 119).</a> Genuine, or <i>samma-d-aññā</i> is, of course, intended by the Commentary. This, in <a href="#51_v96"><i>Dhammapada,</i> verse 96,</a> is rendered by Fausböll <i>absoluta gognitio;</i> by Max Müller, &apos;true knowledge.&apos; That the testifying to it is as old as the Four Nikāyas, appears from the little episode in the <a href="#466_"><i>Aŋguttara Nikāya</i> iii. 359:</a> - Two disciples who have newly realized this intuitive knowledge or gnosis, wait upon the Buddha and testify to the same before him. As hey again depart, the Buddha remarks: &apos;Even so do men of true breed declae gnosis <i>(aññā)</i>: - they tell of the good they have won <i>(attha),</i> but they do not bring in their ego <i>(attā).</i>&apos; That the public individual testimony to the assurance of salvation won, invited yesterday and to-day in Christian revivalist meetings, should have been thus anticipated 2000 years ago in Buddhist usage, is an interesting link. And <i>aññā</i> is rarely attainment of such consciousness: - the &apos;fruition of arahantshp&apos; <i>(arahattaphala).</i></p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Yes, lord,&apos; they replied;<br/>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of a monk who reflects thus:</p>

					and overcome by age,<br/>
					not easy is it<br/>
					to turn to the Buddhas&apos; word,<br/>
					not easy things<br/>

					<p class="f4">Ere<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#530_n3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span> that state come to me —<br/>

					and of that state possessed<br/>
					I will dwell comforted even when old.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this is the first fear in the way<br/>

					<p class="f4">Again take the case of a monk who reflects thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">I have health and well-being,<br/>

					which is neither over-cold<br/>
					nor over-heated,<br/>
					but even and suitable for striving;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#530_n4" id="fn4">4</a>]</sup></span> but time will be<br/>
					when sickness shall touch this body;<br/>
					and sick and ill,<br/>
					not easy is it<br/>
					to turn to the Buddhas&apos; word,<br/>
					not easy things<br/>
					are forest-wilderness,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again take the case of a monk who reflects thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Now is there no famine<br/>
					and crops are good,<br/>
					food is easy to get<br/>
					and it is easy<br/>
					to keep oneself going<br/>
					by gleanings and favours;<br/>
					but time will be<br/>
					when there is a famine,<br/>
					bad crops,<br/>
					and difficulty in getting food,<br/>
					nor will it be easy<br/>
					to keep oneself going<br/>
					by gleanings and favours;<br/>
					and the famine-stricken men<br/>
					will move to where there is ample food,<br/>
					and there one will dwell in a crowd<br/>
					and a throng:<br/>
					and where such conditions are,<br/>
					not easy is it<br/>
					to turn to the Buddhas&apos; word,<br/>
					not easy things<br/>
					are forest-wilderness,<br/>
					the outland bed and seat, to seek.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ere that state come to me —<br/>

					lof I will put forth energy<br/>
					against that time<br/>
					even to attain the unattained,<br/>
					to master the unmastered, to realize the unrealized,<br/>
					and of that state possessed<br/>
					I will dwell comforted even in time of famine.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this is the third fear in the way<br/>
					from contemplating which<br/>
					the earnest,<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					resolute monk,<br/>
					ought to live<br/>
					just to attain the unattained,<br/>
					to master the unmastered,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again take the case of a monk who reflects thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Now men dwell in friendly fellowship together,<br/>

					but time will be<br/>
					when fear is about,<br/>
					perils of robbers,<br/>
					and the country-folk mount their carts<br/>
					and drive away,<br/>
					and the fear-stricken men<br/>
					will move away<br/>
					to where there is safety,<br/>
					and there one will live in crowds<br/>
					and throngs:<br/>
					and where such conditions are,<br/>

					to master the unmastered, to realize the unrealized,<br/>
					and of that state possessed<br/>
					I will dwell comforted even in time of fear.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this is the fourth fear in the way<br/>

					the earnest,<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					resolute monk,<br/>
					ought to live<br/>
					just to attain the unattained,<br/>
					to master the unmastered,<br/>
					to realize the unrealized.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, monks, the monk reflects thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the Order lives in friendly fellowship together,<br/>
					finding comfort in one teaching;<br/>
					but the time will come<br/>
					when the Order will be rent:<br/>
					and when that happens,<br/>
					not easy is it to turn to the Buddhas&apos; word,<br/>
					not easy things<br/>
					are forest-wilderness,<br/>
					the outland <a id="530_pg84"><span class="f2 g"><b>[84]</b></span></a> bed and seat, to seek.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ere that state come to me —<br/>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this is the fifth fear in the way<br/>

							<p><i>Be Warned! This is Mrs. Rhys Davids in all her glory. Spouting her essentially Mahayanist view and making her usual unproven (and unprovable) assertions.</i></p>
							
							<p>From the Introduction, by Mrs. Rhys Davids: &quot;Lastly, a word in passing on the frequent occurrence in this volume of the term <i>bhāvanīyo,</i> with or without the prefix <i>mano-</i> (mind). Here we have the compound for the first time translated rightly. Let the reader consult <a href="#554_pg225">p. 225</a> and <a href="#554_n1">n. 1.</a> The Commentarial definition <i>ettha manaŋ vaḍḍheti</i> means &apos;herein one makes the mind grow.&apos; It was at the very heart of original Buddhism, that the very man, spirit, soul, should be &apos;made to grow,&apos; made to become. And the mind was not the very man, as the second so-called &apos;sermon&apos; warned men. But there had been growing a new culture of &apos;the mind&apos; in India, due to Kapila, <i>fl.</i> probably a generation or two before Buddhism began. And experts in this culture, members of the Sakyan Order, are probably meant by the compound term. Its immense influence on Buddhism I have discussed elsewhere. We note this in the fairly obvious gloss with which the mainly ancient Dhammapada begins:</p>
							
							      <p class="in2"><i>Things are forerun by mind, have mind as best, are compounds of the mind.<br/>
							      If with corrupted mind a man do speak or act,<br/>therefrom ill follows him as wheel the foot of drawing beast.</i></p>
									
							<p>Here the couplet proper, &apos;If ... beast,&apos; is in keeping with the Upanishads - the man acting &apos;with his mind.&apos; But the inserted superfluous first line is the new note due to Kapila&apos;s influence; yet not altogether new, but in a way an echo and revival of the high importance seen in mind (manas) in the earlier Brāhmaṇa books of ritual; sayings - for so they then were - which may have inspired Kapila.</p>
							
							<p>Bhāvanīyo without the mano is at times a very hard word to translate. Not on <a href="#555_pg192">p. 192,</a> where &apos;becomes not what he ought to become&apos; <i>(a-bhāvanīyo hoti)</i> is unexceptionable; so <a href="#552_pg87">p. 87.</a> This is literally correct, but in the compound, the &apos;participle of necessity&apos; in <i>-iyo</i> seems to me not here at all; we have the affix of agency: <i>-iko</i> or <i>-iyo.</i> This gives us a &apos;mind-making-becom-er,&apos; an uncouth compound with is fairly well rendered by &apos;student of mind.&apos; Let the reader not think I comment on trifles. In the wording of growth, of a making to grow, making become, we have the one central driving force that arose with Buddhism. That man &apos;is&apos; was not enough. Man must become a More, else never will he attain to his full stature as God: - here is original Buddhism carrying out to the Many the torch drooping in the hands of the Brahman teaching of the Few.</p>

							<p><a href="#199_"><i>Psalms of the Brethren,</i></a> Introduction, pg xxxiii: &quot;... the so-often reiterated record that the poems were first publicly uttered as &apos;confessions of <i>aññā,</i>&apos; deserves a passing word. The history of this term, of its use and of its <i>non-</i>use, in Buddhism has yet to be written. Signifying literally <i>ad-sciens,</i> &apos;ac-knowledging,&apos; <i>aññā</i> is used in the Suttanta books to signify that mental flash, or suffusion of intuitive knowledge and assurance of &apos;salvation&apos; constituting emancipation, or aarahantship. The Buddha testifies to having realized it under the Bodhi-Tree, but uses the kindred, less specialized word <i>ñāṇa.</i> In the mouth of bhikkhus such testifying was no guarantee of right <i>(sammā)</i> gnosis; it might be made through mental illusion, conceit, frenzy, or even evil design <a href="#595_">(<i>Aŋguttara</i> iii, 119).</a> Genuine, or <i>samma-d-aññā</i> is, of course, intended by the Commentary. This, in <a href="#51_v96">Dhammapada, verse 96,</a> is rendered by Fausböll <i>absoluta cognitio;</i> by Max Müller, &apos;true knowledge.&apos; That the testifying to it is as old as the Four Nikāyas, appears from the little episode in the <a href="#28_p49"><i>Aŋguttara Nikāya,</i> iii. 359</a>: - Two disciples who have newly realized this intuitive knowledge or gnosis, wait upon the Buddha and testify to the same before him. As they again depart, the Buddha remarks: &apos;Even so do men of true breed declare gnosis <i>(aññā);</i> - they tell of the good they have won <i>(attha),</i> but they do not bring in their ego <i>(attā).</i> [Footnote: The context shows that no derogatory judgment on confessions, such as these poems contain, is implied, but that only self-conceit and self-advertisement are condemned. Cf. ... <a href="#596_v1076">vs 1076.</a>] That the public individual testimony to the assurance of salvation won, invited yesterday and to-day in Christian revivalist meetings, should have been thus anticipated 2000 years ago in Buddhist usage, is an interesting link. And <i>aññā</i> is rarely met with except in connexion with the confession of the attainment of such consciousness: - the &apos;fruition of arahantship&apos; <i>(arahattaphala).</i></p>

							<p><i>Psalms of the Brethren,</i> pg xxxix-xl: &quot;The leaning of so many of our Theras, however, to prolonged spells of monachistic life in wild, or, at least, retired places, is perhaps not a safe guide by which to judge the early Buddhist Order generally. That Order gathered into itself every variety of temperament, every grade of religious capacity. Many of them were quite unfit for various reasons to make religious progress in solitude. And in one of Thera Subhūti&apos;s verses, not included in this collection, he summons the unfit to leave it:</p>
							
							      <p class="f3 in2">&apos;Infected as thou art by lust,<br/>
							      By ill-will and illusin&apos;s taint,<br/>
							      Come thou away and leave the wood!<br/>
							      This is the home of souls made pure,<br/>
							      Of stainless anchorites austere.<br/>
							      Defile not thou the purified;<br/>
							      Come thou away and leave the wood!&apos;</p>
									
							<p>In fact, only the Arahant is pronounced to be really fit to dwell in such solitudes. And even among the Theras themselves we find instances of unfitness for the monastic life, both through immaturity of training and through individual temperment.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">And the man saw the Exalted One<br/>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4">Then thought the venerable Sāriputta:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Verily, before the face of the Exalted One,<br/>
					even unto a third time<br/>
					the venerable Udāyin cries against me<br/>
					and no monk supports me;<br/>
					I had best be silent.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">And so the venerable Sāriputta was silent.</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the venerable Udāyin and said;</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;But who, do you hold,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#571_n7" id="fn7">7</a>]</sup></span> Udāyin, has a mind-pictured body?&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="571_pg143"><span class="f2 g"><b>[143]</b></span></a>&apos;Those devas, lord, who are formless,<br/>
					perception-made.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Why thinkest thou, Udāyin,<br/>
					that the word of a witless fool like thee<br/>
					is just the thing to declare?</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the Venerable Ānanda thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Is it possible,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#571_n8" id="fn8">8</a>]</sup></span> Ānanda,<br/>
					that you can look on with indifference<br/>
					at an elder monk being vexed?</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, Ānanda,<br/>
					compassion grows not<br/>
					from (suffering) an elder monk to be vexed.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Herein, monks, a monk,<br/>
					who has achieved virtue,<br/>
					achieved concentration,<br/>
					achieved insight,<br/>
					may both completely enter<br/>
					the ending of perception and feeling<br/>
					and may emerge therefrom —<br/>
					this is so.</p>

					<p class="f4">If here among visible things<br/>
					he make not the gain of gnosis,<br/>
					he will surely go beyond<br/>
					the deva-community that feed on solid food<br/>
					and arise in a mind-pictured body,<br/>
					provided he enter<br/>
					and emerge<br/>
					from the ending of perception and feeling —<br/>
					this is so.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One;<br/>
					and when he had thus spoken,<br/>
					the Well-Gone arose and entered the dwelling.</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4">Now not long after the departure of the Exalted One,<br/>
					the venerable Ānanda went up to the venerable Upavāna<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#571_n9" id="fn9">9</a>]</sup></span> and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Just now, venerable Upavāna,<br/>
					some (monks) were vexing the elder monk<br/>
					and we never protested unto them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore wonder not, venerable sir,<br/>
					should the Exalted One,<br/>
					after coming from seclusion,<br/>
					bring<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#571_n10" id="fn10">10</a>]</sup></span> the matter up<br/>
					and<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#571_n11" id="fn11">11</a>]</sup></span> relate the whole affair<br/>
					to the venerable Upavāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">Already even fearfulness<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#571_n12" id="fn12">12</a>]</sup></span> is come upon us.&apos;</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4">And in the evening,<br/>
					after coming from seclusion,<br/>
					the Exalted One went to the service hall,<br/>
					and, when come, he sat down on <a id="571_pg144"><span class="f2 g"><b>[144]</b></span></a> the seat that was ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he said to the venerable Upavāna:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Having how many qualities, Upavāna,<br/>
					does an elder among his fellows in the godly life<br/>
					become pious,<br/>
					loved,<br/>
					respected<br/>
					and what he ought to become?</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Lord, having five<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#571_n13" id="fn13">13</a>]</sup></span> qualities,<br/>
					an elder among his fellows in the godly life<br/>

					loved,<br/>
					respected<br/>
					and what he ought to become.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, herein he is virtuous,<br/>
					abides restrained by the restraint of the Obligations,<br/>
					is perfect in conduct and habit,<br/>
					sees peril in the smallest fault,<br/>
					accepts the training<br/>
					and trains himself accordantly;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">he is learned,<br/>
					with mind retentive and well stored;<br/>
					those things lovely in the beginning,<br/>
					lovely in the middle,<br/>
					lovely in the end,<br/>
					which set forth in spirit and in letter<br/>
					the godly life of purity,<br/>
					perfect in its entirety —<br/>
					those are fully learnt by him,<br/>
					resolved upon,<br/>
					made familiar by speech,<br/>
					pondered over in the mind,<br/>
					fully understood in theory.;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">he has a pleasant voice,<br/>
					a good enunciation,<br/>
					is urbane in speech,<br/>
					distinct,<br/>
					free from hoarseness<br/>
					and informative;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">at will,<br/>
					easily and without trouble,<br/>
					he attains to the four states of musing,<br/>
					which bring comfort<br/>
					both here and now,<br/>
					transcending thought;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">by destroying the cankcrs<br/>
					he enters and abides in the emancipation of the heart<br/>
					and of insight,<br/>
					which is free of the cankers,<br/>
					and this state he knows and realizes for himself,<br/>
					even in this life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, lord, having these five qualities<br/>
					an elder among his fellows in the godly life<br/>
					becomes pious,<br/>
					loved,<br/>
					respected<br/>
					and what he oughtght to become.&apos;</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Well (said), well (said), Upavāna!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is even (as you say): having these five qualities<br/>
					an elder among his fellows in the godly life<br/>
					becomes pious,<br/>
					loved,<br/>
					respected<br/>
					and what he oughtght to become.</p>

					<p class="f4">If these five qualities are not completely found in an elder,<br/>
					will his fellows in the godly life respect,<br/>
					honour,<br/>
					reverence<br/>
					and venerate him<br/>
					for his broken teeth,<br/>
					his grey hairs,<br/>
					his wrinkled skin?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#571_n14" id="fn14">14</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">But verily, Upavāna, when these five things are found in an elder,<br/>
					then his fellows in the godly life respect him,<br/>
					honour,<br/>
					reverence<br/>
					and venerate him.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One with<br/>
					a great following of monks<br/>
					walked a walk among the <a href="#11_kosala">Kosalans</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">And as the Exalted One went along the highway<br/>
					he saw a place where grew a big grove of sal trees;<br/>
					and seeing it there,<br/>
					he moved down from the road<br/>
					and went towards it<br/>
					and made his way among the trees;<br/>
					and at a certain place<br/>
					he smiled.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#908_n1" id="fn1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;What cause now,<br/>
					what reason<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#908_n2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					moved the Exalted One to show a smile?</p>

					<p class="f4">Not for nothing<br/>
					do Tathāgatas smile.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Ānanda asked him<br/>
					concerning the matter:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;What cause now,<br/>
					what reason<br/>
					moved the Exalted One to show a smile?</p>

					<p class="f4">Not for nothing<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">(Then said the Exalted One:)</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;At this place, Ānanda,<br/>
					in olden times<br/>
					there was a rich and flourishing city<br/>

					arahant,<br/>
					fully enlightened;<br/>
					and Gavesin was a lay-disciple<br/>

					but he kept not the moral precepts.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">Now beoause of Gavesin<br/>
					there were about five hundred who testified<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#908_n4" id="fn4">4</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					and were stirred to discipleship,<br/>
					but they kept not the moral precepts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thought he:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;I have greatly served these five hundred lay-disciples,<br/>
					being the first to move and bestir myself;<br/>
					yet I keep not the moral precepts<br/>
					nor do these five hundred others.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is a levelling of levels,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#908_n5" id="fn5">5</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					leaving no whit of a more.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come now.</p>

					<p class="f4">I&apos;m for something more!&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">So Gavesin went up to the five hundred<br/>
					and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Know, good sirs,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#908_n6" id="fn6">6</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					from today<br/>
					that I keep the moral precepts.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, those five hundred<br/>
					thought to themselves:</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, brāhman,<br/>

					<p class="f4">But it is marvellous what you say, Master Gotama,<br/>
					it&apos;s wonderful, Master Gotama!<sup>[<a href="#840_edn1" id="edfn1">ed1</a>]</sup></p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Tis just as if one had set upright a thing toppled over,<br/>

					so that those that had eyes could see objects —<br/>
					it is just thus that Dhamma has been blazed abroad by Master Gotama in manifold ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;I, Master Gotama,<br/>

					<p class="f4">And<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#966_n1" id="fn1">1</a>]</sup></span> some were dark, dark-skinned, in dark clothes clad, darkly adorned;<br/>

					and some were white, pale-skinned, in white clothes clad, in white adorned;<br/>
					but of a truth the Exalted One, in grace and glory, outshone them all.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now brāhman Pingiyānin rose from his seat, girt his upper robe about his shoulder, bent forth his outstretched hands to the Exalted One and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Speak thou that thing, Pingiyānin said the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then brāhman Pingiyānin extolled the Exalted One before his face in this same verse:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#966_n3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

However, when the Chinese pilgrims Fa Hsien and Yuan Chwang visited it, Buddhism flourished there (Watters, p. 301). Quoting the <i>Mūla sarvā.stivāda-nikāya-vinaya,</i> he gives the following five &apos;defects&apos;: the ground was uneven, it was covered with stones and brickbats, it abounded in prickly shrubs, the people took solitary meals, and there were too many women&apos; (p. 312, vol. i).</p>
