It is impossible here to do more than give references. <a href="#74_"><i>Thera-</i></a> and <a href="#75_"><i>Therī-gāthā</i></a> (<i>Psalms of Brethren and Sisters,</i>) contain a short summary of each, according to Dhammapāla Ācariya who does not, however, refer to the Commentary he quotes from as Buddhaghosa&apos;s Manoratha-Pūraṇī, probably a recast of other and older traditions and Commentaries. Of the twenty-eight monks here named all but two have verses ascribed to them in <i>Theragāthā</i>. This chapter is called <i>Etad Aggaŋ</i> (&apos;this is the top, the cream of&apos;). The tradition, and probably no more than that, was that these disciples were thus singled out for honour at the Jetavana &apos;Great Minster,&apos; some fourteen years after the Great Enlightenment. <i>Cf.</i> <a href="#76_"><i>K.S.</i> ii, 108</a> for five of them.</p>

							<p>page 417 (Appendix): Page 284: Read Annā Kondañña. It is interesting to note that the Burmese MS. of the Commentary, when commencing his legend, retains the original form Aññāsi-Kondañña. The Buddha, namely, when he had convinced this, his first disciple, is said to have exclaimed, <i>Aññasi vato bho Kondañño!</i> (Truly Kondañña has perceived!), and the latter became known as Aññāta-Kondañña (&quot;Kondañña who has that which is perceived&quot;) (<i>Vinaya Texts,</i> i. 98). In subsequent allusions the Commentary calls him simply Kondañña, or Kondañña-mānava. In <i>Milinda,</i> ii., 44, where the eight brahmins names are given, he is called Yañña. <i>Cf. Buddhist Birth Stories (Nidāna-Kathā),</i> p. 72 f., 113, where he is called Yañña, and Aññā-Kondañña respectively.</p>

							<p>Page 415 (starts 414) (Appendix): Page 110: n.4.: It should have here been stated that <i>piṇḍola</i> is Pāli for beggar, almsman. Childer&apos;s Dictionary does not know the word. Not recognizing it as a purely common name, the translator and even the editor of the <i>Iti-vuttaka</i> (§91) have yielded to the obstructive association created by the well-known soubriquet. Yet both Dhammapāla&apos;s Commentary (on <i>Iti-vutaka</i>) and that on the parallel <i>Saŋyutta,</i> iii. 93 are clear: - <i>piṇḍāya uḷatīti piṇḍolo: piṇḍolassa kammaŋ piṇḍolyaŋ.</i> The soubriquet of Beggar-Bhāradvāja may have been given by contemptuous kinsfolk. On the abuse bestowed on the beggar (specimens are given in the latter Commentary) see <a href="#91_v1118">Tālaputa&apos;s verse (1118).</a> It appears that Piṇḍola is the name of a &quot;Wandering Jew&quot; bhikkhu in Chinese Buddhist legends. But it is clear from both the translated and the excised legends in Dhammapāla&apos;s Commentary, that he knew nothing about that. Cf. A.J. Edmunds, <i>Buddhist and Christian Gospels,</i> ii, 264.</p>

It is noticeable that in the above list of the monks none has such a title. <i>Comy.</i> says: &apos;Of one Buddha four disciples only have great abnormal powers. The remainder can recall 100,000 kalpas, not beyond that: but those who have attained great abnormal powers can recall incalculable eras. Under our Teacher&apos;s rule the two Great Disciples and the elder Bakkula and Bhaddā Kaccānā., just these four, had this power&apos; (Bakkula, however, in the list above is only credited with good health).</p>

For his death and subsequent apparition <i>Cf.</i> <a href="#199_pg262"><i>M.</i> iii, 262;</a> <a href="#200_p20"><i>S.</i> i, 55.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a href="#185_fn109" id="n109">109</a>]</sup>This layman, eminent for his knowledge of Dhamma, is fully described in the <a href="#201_"><i>Citta-Saɱyutta</i>,</a> <i>S.</i> iv (<i>K.S.</i> iv, 190 <i>ff.</i>). Text has <i>Macchika-;</i> <a href="#202_p120"><i>A.</i> iii, 451,</a> <i>Macchikā</i>-.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a href="#185_fn110" id="n110">110</a>]</sup>Exposed in childhood as food for a <i>yakkha</i>, whom the Master converted, he was handed by the former to the latter, who returned him. Then, delivered over to the king&apos;s messenger (<i>hatthato hatthaŋ gahetvā</i>), being thus &apos;handed from hand to hand,&apos; he was given this nickname. When he grew up he entered the Paths and gathered a large following by the four <i>vatthū</i> of liberality, kind speech, a useful life and equal treatment to all alike. <i>Cf.

The only other mention of him in the Nikāyas appears to be at <a href="#202_p120"><i>A.</i> iii, 451</a> (B. <i>Sūro Kammaṭho</i>), where the same list of laymen occurs. After hearing a sermon of the Master on the impermanence of all <i>skandhas</i> he was at first deceived by Māra, the &apos;Evil One,&apos; who personated the Buddha and said: &apos;<i>Some skandhas</i> are permanent.&apos; His loyalty made him see through the deception.&apos;</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a href="#185_fn115" id="n115">115</a>]</sup>Exposed at birth on a rubbish-heap at Rājagaha, he was found by the prince Abhaya, who brought him up: hence the name. In his sixteenth year he went to Takkasilā, the famous-university, to study medicine, was honoured by the rājah Bimbisāra, and cured the rājah Candapajjota. He lived on Vulture&apos;s Peak and also cured the Master of a sickness. <i>Cf. Vin.</i> i, 268 ff.</p>

According to the legend he had been the Buddha&apos;s father or other relative in 500 births, while Nakulamātā had been his mother, etc. The couple attained the Paths together.<br/>
					(The list referred to at <a href="#202_p120"><i>A.</i> iii 451</a> contains ten other laymen — viz., Tavakaṇṇika, Pūraṇa, Isidatta, Sandhāna, Vijaya, Vajjiyamahita, Meṇḍaka, the housefathers; and Vāseṭṭha, Ariṭṭha, Sāragga, lay followers; who realized the Deathless through unwavering loyalty to the Buddha, Dhamma and Order, and through Ariyan morality, knowledge and release.)</p>
