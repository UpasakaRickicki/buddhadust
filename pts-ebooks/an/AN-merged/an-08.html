					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Uttara<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#79_n1" id="fn1">1</a>]</sup></span> dwelt near Mahisavatthu,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the Royal deva, <a href="#83_">Vessavana,</a><br/>

					well it is for him to review<br/>

					<p class="f4">Then just as a strong man might stretch forth his bended arm<br/>
					or might bend his outstretched arm;<br/>
					even so the Royal deva, Vessavana,<br/>
					disappeared from Dhavajalika<br/>
					and appeared among the devas of the Thirty.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Vessavana approached Sakka, king of the devas, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Your<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#79_n3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span> grace, I would have you know<br/>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Well it is, from time to time,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Then as a strong man might bend<br/>
					and stretch out his arm again,<br/>
					Sakka, king of the devas, disappeared from among the devas of the Thirty<br/>
					and appeared before the venerable Uttara in Dhavajalika,<br/>
					on the Sankheyyaka mountain,<br/>
					near Mahisavatthu.</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p>Sakka did not &apos;sit&apos; he stood. <i>aṭṭhāsi.</i> The Devas, we hear, find this world more than a little distasteful, and when they visit, do not &apos;sit in it&apos;.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Sakka, the deva-king,<br/>
					approached the venerable Uttara<br/>
					and saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Is it true, sir,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#79_n4" id="fn4">4</a>]</sup></span> as they say,<br/>
					that the venerable Uttara teaches this doctrine to the monks,<br/>

					well it is to review another&apos;s;<br/>
					well it is to review one&apos;s own attainments;<br/>
					well it is to review another&apos;s.&quot;&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, certainly, Deva-king.</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;But pray, sir,<br/>
					is this the venerable Uttara&apos;s own saying,<br/>
					or is it the word of that Exalted One,<br/>
					arahant,<br/>
					the fully awakened One?</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Now, O Deva-king,<br/>
					I will give you an analogy,<br/>
					for it is by analogy<br/>

					<p class="f4">Imagine, O King, a great heap of grain<br/>

					<p class="f4">For this good purpose, monks,<br/>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#155_n1" id="fn1">1</a>]</sup></span>Once the Exalted One was dwelling in the Gabled Hall in Mahāvana, near <a href="#11_vesali">Vesālī</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time a great many Licchavi notables were seated assembled in the Mote Hall;<br/>
					and in many a figure they were speaking in praise of the Buddha,<br/>
					in praise of Dhamma,<br/>
					in praise of the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">And <a href="#158_">Sīha</a>, the general, the disciple of the Nigaṇṭhas,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#155_n2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span> was seated in that assembly.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thought he:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Surely that Exalted One must be arahant,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Thus indeed these many notable Licchavis,<br/>
					assembled and seated in their Mote Hall,<br/>
					in many a figure praise the Buddha,<br/>
					praise Dhamma,<br/>
					praise the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now suppose I were to go and see him,<br/>
					the Exalted One,<br/>
					arahant,<br/>
					fully awakened.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Sīha approached the Nigaṇṭha, Nāṭaputa and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Sir,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#155_n3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span> I wish to go and see the recluse Gotama.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Sīha, how can you,<br/>

					<p class="f4">The recluse Gotama professes the theory of inaction,<br/>

					and in that he trains his disciples.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then whatever inclination<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#155_n4" id="fn4">4</a>]</sup></span> Sīha had to go and see the Exalted One subsided.</p>

					<p class="f4">On a second occasion the Licchavi notables were seated assembled in the Mote Hall;<br/>

					in praise of the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Sīha, the general, the disciple of the Nigaṇṭhas, was seated in that assembly.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Sīha approached the Nigaṇṭha, Nāṭaputa and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Sīha, how can you,<br/>

					<p class="f4">On a third occasion occasion the Licchavi notables were seated assembled in the Mote Hall;<br/>

					in praise of Dhamma,<br/>
					in praise of the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Sīha, the general, the disciple of the Nigaṇṭhas, was seated in that assembly.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thought he:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Surely that <a id="155_pg125"><span class="f2 g"><b>[125]</b></span></a> Exalted One must be arahant,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Then Sīha approached the Nigaṇṭha, Nāṭaputa and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Sīha, how can you,<br/>

					<p class="f4">The recluse Gotama professes the theory of inaction,<br/>

					and in that he trains his disciples.&apos;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Thought Sīha:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Undoubtedly that Exalted One is arahant,<br/>
					fully awakened,<br/>
					and so these Licchavis assembled and seated in their Mote Hall,<br/>
					in many a figure praise the Buddha,<br/>
					praise Dhamma,<br/>
					praise the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">What can the Nigaṇṭhas do to me,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#155_n5" id="fn5">5</a>]</sup></span> whether they are consulted or not?</p>

					<p class="f4">What if I go without the Nigaṇṭhas&apos; leave and see that Exalted One,<br/>
					arahant,<br/>
					fully awakened?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">So at noon, Sīha set out from Vesālī<br/>

					and then descending therefrom,<br/>
					entered the Park on foot.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#155_n6" id="fn6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Approaching the Exalted One, he saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Lord, I have heard this:</p>

					<p class="f4">I presume they report what the Exalted One has said<br/>
					and do not misrepresent the Exalted One by lying.</p>

					<p class="f4">I presume they set forth a doctrine<br/>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a href="#178_edfn1" id="edn1">ed1</a>]</sup> Hare abbreviates this list. In this Volume he has previously used &quot;resolve&quot; for <a href="#190_"><i>saŋkappa</i></a> (p 28, <a href="#191_">AN 7 42</a>), which is commented on by Mrs. Rhys Davids: &quot;...is to waste a strong word on a weaker. I have gone into this makeshift for &apos;will&apos; elsewhere ... &apos;To fit&apos; <i>(kḷp)</i> is here the root-idea. In it we have the man as India saw him, 600 BC., thinking, then adapting, fitting act to thought. But &apos;resolve&apos; is a very synergy of the whole man; will to act with coefficient of thought and desire.&quot; This editor has suggested in his own translations the use of the word &apos;principles&apos;, for what is fit and proper. In Volume III, p 292 [<a href="#192_">AN 6.63</a>] Hare gives &apos;right purpose&apos;.</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Yes, lord,&quot; they replied.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One, and thereafter,<br/>
					rising from his seat,<br/>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p class="f4">Now a certain monk,<br/>

					and there sat down on a seat made ready for him,<br/>
					And Ugga of Vesali approached that monk,<br/>
					saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said that monk to Ugga:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;It has been declared by the Exalted One<br/>
					that you, O householder,<br/>
					are possessed of eight marvelous and wonderful qualities.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What are those eight marvelous and wonderful qualities, householder,<br/>
					of which you are declared by the Exalted One to be possessed?&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Nay, reverend sir,<br/>
					I know not of what eight marvelous and wonderful qualities<br/>
					I am declared by the Exalted One to be possessed;<br/>

					<p class="f4">Very well, householder,<br/>
					replied the monk;<br/>
					and Ugga said:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;When I first saw the Exalted One,<br/>
					even a long way off,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, with tranquil heart<br/>
					I drew nigh and reverenced the Exalted One.</p>

					that is to say:<br/>
					on almsgiving,<br/>
					on virtue<br/>
					and on heaven.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He set forth the peril,<br/>
					the folly,<br/>
					the depravity of lusts<br/>
					and the advantages of renunciation.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#175_n2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And when the Exalted One knew<br/>
					that my heart was clear, malleable,<br/>
					free from hindrance,<br/>
					uplifted,<br/>
					lucid,<br/>
					then he revealed to me<br/>
					that Dhamma-teaching<br/>
					to which Buddhas alone have won,<br/>
					to wit:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Ill,<br/>
					its coming-to-be,<br/>
					its ending<br/>
					and the Way.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a clean cloth,<br/>

					even so, as I sat there,<br/>
					there arose within me<br/>
					the spotless, stainless Dhamma-sight:<br/>
					that whatsoever is conditioned by coming- <a id="175_pg144"><span class="f2 g"><b>[144]</b></span></a> to-be,<br/>

					penetrated Dhamma,<br/>
					overcame doubt,<br/>
					surpassed uncertainty,<br/>
					possessed without another&apos;s aid<br/>
					perfect confidence in the word of the Teacher,<br/>
					and there and then took refuge<br/>
					in the Buddha, in Dhamma and in the Order,<br/>
					and embraced<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#175_n3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span> the five rules of training<br/>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Sisters, I have embraced the five rules of training in the godly life.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Who wishes, may enjoy the wealth of this place,<br/>
					or may do deeds of merit,<br/>
					or may go to her own relations and family;<br/>
					or is there some man you desire<br/>
					to whom I may give you?&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">And when I stopped speaking,<br/>
					the eldest wife said to me:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Sir, give me to such and such a man!</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I had that man sent for;<br/>
					and, taking my wife by the left hand<br/>
					and holding the water pot in my right,<br/>
					I cleansed<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#175_n4" id="fn4">4</a>]</sup></span> that man (by an act of dedication).</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Yet I was not a whit discomfited<br/>
					at parting with my wife.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the third<br/>
					marvelous and wonderful quality found in me.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, sir, there is wealth in my family,<br/>
					but among the good and lovely in character<br/>
					it is shared impartially.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#175_n5" id="fn5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fourth<br/>

					and not without deference.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#175_n6" id="fn6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fifth<br/>
					marvelous and wonderful quality found in me.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">If, sir, that reverend monk preach Dhamma to me,<br/>
					I listen attentively and not listlessly.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If he preach not Dhamma to me,<br/>
					I preach Dhamma to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the sixth<br/>
					marvelous and wonderful quality found in me.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Furthermore, sir,<br/>
					it is not uncommon for devas to come<br/>
					and declare to me:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">&quot;Perfectly, O householder,<br/>
					is Dhamma pro- <a id="175_pg145"><span class="f2 g"><b>[145]</b></span></a> claimed by the Exalted One!&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">When they speak thus, I reply:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">&quot;Ho! You devas,<br/>
					whether you declare so or not,<br/>
					Dhamma is perfectly proclaimed by the Exalted One!&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet, sir, I feel no elation<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#175_n7" id="fn7">7</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					because of such thoughts as:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">&quot;It is to me these devas come.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I am the man who talks to devas.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					is possessed of eight marvellous and wonderful qualities.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">And when the Well-farer had thus spoken,<br/>
					rising from his seat,<br/>
					he entered his dwelling.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="244_pg146"><span class="f2 g"><b>[146]</b></span></a> Now a certain monk,<br/>
					robing himself early in the morning,<br/>
					taking bowl and cloak,<br/>
					went to the house of Ugga, the householder of Hatthigāma,<br/>
					and there sat down on a seat made ready for him,<br/>
					and Ugga the householder of Hatthigāma approached that monk,<br/>
					saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said that monk to Ugga:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;It has been declared by the Exalted One<br/>
					that you, O householder,<br/>
					are possessed of eight marvelous and wonderful qualities.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What are those eight marvelous and wonderful qualities, householder,<br/>
					of which you are declared by the Exalted One to be possessed?&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">Said Ugga, the householder of Hatthigāma:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Nay, reverend sir,<br/>
					I know not of what eight marvelous and wonderful qualities<br/>
					I am declared by the Exalted One to be possessed;<br/>
					but as to the eight marvelous and wonderful qualities found in me,<br/>
					listen, lend and ear and I will tell you.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">Very well, householder,<br/>
					replied the monk;<br/>
					and Ugga said:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;When, sir, I was sporting in Nāga glade,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#244_n2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					I saw the Exalted One a good way off,<br/>
					and at the sight of him,<br/>
					my mind became tranquil<br/>
					and my drunkenness vanished.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the first marvellous and wonderful quality quality found in me.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, with tranquil heart<br/>
					I drew nigh and reverenced the Exalted One.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And to me he preached a graduated discourse,<br/>
					that is to say:<br/>
					on almsgiving,<br/>
					on virtue<br/>
					and on heaven.<br/>
					He set forth the peril,<br/>
					the folly,<br/>
					the depravity of lusts<br/>
					and the advantages of renunciation.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when the Exalted One knew<br/>
					that my heart was clear, malleable,<br/>
					free from hindrance,<br/>
					uplifted,<br/>
					lucid,<br/>
					then he revealed to me<br/>
					that Dhamma-teaching<br/>
					to which Buddhas alone have won,<br/>
					to wit:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Ill,<br/>
					its coming-to-be,<br/>
					its ending<br/>
					and the Way.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a clean cloth,<br/>
					free of all stain,<br/>
					will take dye perfectly;<br/>
					even so, as I sat there,<br/>
					there arose within me<br/>
					the spotless, stainless Dhamma-sight:<br/>
					that whatsoever is conditioned by coming-to-be,<br/>
					all that is subject to ending.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, sir, saw Dhamma,<br/>
					possessed Dhamma,<br/>
					found Dhamma,<br/>
					penetrated Dhamma,<br/>
					overcame doubt,<br/>
					surpassed uncertainty,<br/>
					possessed without another&apos;s aid<br/>
					perfect confidence in the word of the Teacher,<br/>
					and there and then took refuge<br/>
					in the Buddha, in Dhamma and in the Order,<br/>
					and embraced the five rules of training<br/>
					in the godly life.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the second<br/>
					marvelous and wonderful quality found in me.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, sir, I had four wives,<br/>
					young girls,<br/>
					and I went and spoke to them thus:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">&quot;Sisters, I have embraced the five rules of training in the godly life.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Who wishes, may enjoy the wealth of this place,<br/>
					or may do deeds of merit,<br/>
					or may go to her own relations and family;<br/>
					or is there some man you desire<br/>
					to whom I may give you?&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">And when I stopped speaking,<br/>
					the eldest wife said to me:|| ||</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Sir, give me to such and such a man!</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I had that man sent for;<br/>
					and, taking my wife by the left hand<br/>
					and holding the water pot in my right,<br/>
					that man (by an act of dedication).<br/>
					Yet I was not a whit discomfited<br/>
					at parting with my wife.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the third<br/>
					marvelous and wonderful quality found in me.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, sir, there is wealth in my family,<br/>
					but among the good and lovely in character<br/>
					it is shared impartially.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fourth<br/>
					marvelous and wonderful quality found in me.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And when I wait upon a monk, sir,<br/>
					I serve him respectfully<br/>
					and not without deference.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fifth<br/>
					marvelous and wonderful quality found in me.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">It is, sir, nothing wonderful for devas to come and tell me,<br/>
					when I have invited the Order,<br/>
					that such an one is freed-both-ways;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#244_n3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					that he is wisdom-freed;<br/>
					that he is a seer-in-body;<br/>
					that he is a view-winner;<br/>
					that he is faith-freed;<br/>
					that he is a Dhamma-follower;<br/>
					that he is a faith-follower;<br/>
					that he is virtuous and lovely in character;<br/>
					or that such an one is wicked and evil in character.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, sir, while I wait on the Order,<br/>
					I wot of no such thoughts,<br/>
					suggesting:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#244_n4" id="fn4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">To him I will give little.</p>

					<p class="f4">To him I will give much.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rather, sir, I give impartially.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the sixth quality<br/>
					marvelous and wonderful quality found in me.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Furthermore, sir,<br/>
					it is not uncommon for devas to come<br/>
					and declare to me:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">&quot;Perfectly, O householder,<br/>
					is Dhamma proclaimed by the Exalted One!&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">When they speak thus, I reply:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">&quot;Ho! You devas,<br/>
					whether you declare so or not,<br/>
					Dhamma is perfectly proclaimed by the Exalted One!&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet, sir, I feel no elation<br/>
					because of such thoughts as:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is to me these devas come.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am the man who talks to devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the seventh<br/>
					marvelous and wonderful quality found in me.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, sir, if I should die before the Exalted One,<br/>
					that would not be very wonderful.</p>

					<p class="f4">But that the Exalted One should declare of me:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;There is no fetter,<br/>
					fettered by which,<br/>
					Ugga, the householder of Hatthigāma,<br/>
					shall come again to this world&quot;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#244_n5" id="fn5">5</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					- (that is wonderful).</p>

					<p class="f4">This, sir, is the eighth marvellous and wonderful quality found in me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, sir, these are the eight<br/>
					marvellous and wonderful quality found in me<br/>
					but I know not of what eight<br/>
					marvellous and wonderful qualities<br/>
					I am declared by the Exalted One to be possessed.&apos;</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p class="f4">Then that monk,<br/>
					after taking alms at Ugga&apos;s house,<br/>
					rose from his seat and departed.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And when he had eaten his meal,<br/>
					after his alms-round,<br/>
					he went to the Exalted One<br/>
					and saluting him,<br/>
					sat down at one side.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he told the Exalted One<br/>
					of all his conversation<br/>
					with Ugga the householder of Hatthigāma.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Well done, well done, monk!</p>

					<p class="f4">As Ugga, the householder of Hatthigāma,<br/>
					in explaining the matter rightly<br/>
					should explain;<br/>
					even so, monk,<br/>
					he is declared by me<br/>
					to be possessed of those eight<br/>
					marvelous and wonderful qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, monk,<br/>
					hold it true<br/>
					that Ugga, the householder of Hatthigāma, is so possessed!&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, lord, there is wealth in my family,<br/>

					<p class="f4">This Dhamma is for one who has <a href="#318_">set up mindfulness</a>,<br/>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Yes, lord,&quot; they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;Endowed with four qualities, Monks,<br/>

					therein she is deft and nimble;<br/>
					gifted with an inquiring turn of mind<br/>
					into all such undertakings,<br/>
					she is able to arrange and carry them out.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way a woman is capable at her work.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And how does she manage the servants?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever her husband&apos;s household consists of -<br/>

					or workfolk -<br/>
					she knows the work of each<br/>
					by what has been done;<br/>

					<p class="f4">What her lord reckons to be unlovely,<br/>

					the Exalted One.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is her faith.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">She abstains from taking life,<br/>
					from stealing,<br/>
					from the lusts of the flesh,<br/>
					from lying<br/>
					and from drinking liquor,<br/>
					the cause of sloth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is her virtue.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is she accomplished in charity?</p>

					<p class="f4">She dwells at bome with heart purged of the stain of avarice,<br/>
					given over to charity,<br/>
					open-handed,<br/>
					delighting in giving,<br/>
					yoke-mate to asking,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Such is her charity.</p>

					with Ariyan penetration of the way<br/>
					to the utter destruction of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is her wisdom.</p>

					even so, Tigerfoot,<br/>
					a clansman experiencing both gain and loss<br/>
					continues his business serenely,<br/>
					neither unduly elated<br/>

					<p class="f4">If, Tigerfoot, this clansman have but small earnings<br/>

					<p class="f4">Let Master Gotama teach us such Dhamma<br/>
					as may be to our advantage and happiness in this world,<br/>
					to our advantage and happiness in the next.&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">These four conditions, brāhman,<br/>
					lead to a clansman&apos;s advantage and happiness here on earth.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Achievement in alertness,<br/>
					achievement in wariness,<br/>
					good company<br/>
					and the even life.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, brāhman is achievement in alertness?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, by whatsoever activity a clansman make his living,<br/>
					whether by the plough,<br/>
					by trading<br/>
					or by cattle-herding,<br/>
					by archery<br/>
					or as a rajah&apos;s man,<br/>
					or by any of the crafts -<br/>
					he is deft and tireless;<br/>
					gifted with an inquiring turn of mind<br/>
					into ways and means,<br/>
					he is able to arrange and carry out his job.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called achievement in alertness.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, brāhman is achievement in wariness?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, whatsoever wealth a clansman get together by work and zeal,<br/>
					collect by the strength of his arm,<br/>
					earn by the sweat of his brow<br/>
					and justly obtain in a lawful manner -<br/>
					such he husbands by watch and ward, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Now how can I arrange<br/>
					so that rajahs may not get this wealth out of me,<br/>
					nor thieves filch it,<br/>
					nor fire consume it,<br/>
					nor water carry it off,<br/>
					nor ill-disposed heirs make off with it?&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called achievement in wariness.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, brāhman is good company?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, in whatsoever village or market-town a clansman dwell,<br/>
					he consorts,<br/>
					converses,<br/>
					engages in talk<br/>
					with householders or householders&apos; sons,<br/>
					young men reared in virtue,<br/>
					old men old in virtue,<br/>
					full of faith,<br/>
					virtue,<br/>
					charity<br/>
					and wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">He emulates the fullness of faith<br/>
					in such as are full of faith;<br/>
					he emulates the fullness of virtue<br/>
					in such as are full of virtue;<br/>
					he emulates the fullness of charity<br/>
					in such as are full of charity;<br/>
					he emulates the fullness of wisdom<br/>
					in such as are full of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called good company.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, brāhman is the even life?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a clansman<br/>
					while experiencing both gain and loss in wealth,<br/>
					continues his business serenely,<br/>
					not unduly elated or depressed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thinks he:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Thus my income,<br/>
					after deducting the loss,<br/>
					will stand (at so much)<br/>
					and my outgoings will not exceed my income.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as one who carries scales,<br/>
					or his apprentice,<br/>
					knows, on holding up the balance,<br/>
					that either by so much it has dipped down<br/>
					or by so much it has tilted up;<br/>
					even so, brāhman<br/>
					a clansman experiencing both gain and loss<br/>
					continues his business serenely,<br/>
					neither unduly elated<br/>
					nor unduly depressed,<br/>
					but realizes that<br/>
					after allowing for the loss<br/>
					his income will stand at so much<br/>
					and that his outgoings will not exceed his income.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, brāhman this clansman have but small earnings<br/>
					and live on a grand scale,<br/>
					it will be rumoured of him:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;This clansman eats his wealth<br/>
					like a fig-tree glutton.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">And if his earnings be great<br/>
					and he live meanly,<br/>
					rumour will say of him:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;This clansman will die like a starveling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore this clansman while experiencing both gain and loss in wealth,<br/>
					continues his business serenely,<br/>
					not unduly elated or depressed,<br/>
					but realizes that<br/>
					after allowing for the loss<br/>
					his income will stand at so much<br/>
					and that his outgoings will not exceed his income.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the even life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Brāhman the four channels<br/>
					for the flowing away of amassed wealth<br/>
					are these:<br/>
					looseness with women,<br/>
					debauchery in drinking,<br/>
					knavery in dice-play<br/>
					and friendship,<br/>
					companionship<br/>
					and intimacy with evil doers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as in the case of a great reservoir<br/>
					with only four inlets<br/>
					and only four outlets,<br/>
					if a man should close the inlets<br/>
					and open the outlets<br/>
					and there should be no proper fall of rain,<br/>
					a lessening is to be expected<br/>
					in that great reservoir<br/>
					and not an increase;<br/>
					even so, brāhman there are these four channels<br/>
					for the flowing away of amassed wealth:<br/>
					looseness with women,<br/>
					debauchery in drinking,<br/>
					knavery in dice-play<br/>
					and friendship,<br/>
					companionship<br/>
					and intimacy with evil doers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Brāhman the four channels<br/>
					for the flowing in of great wealth are these:<br/>
					abstinence from looseness with women,<br/>
					from debauchery in drinking,<br/>
					from knavery in dice-play<br/>
					and having friendship,<br/>
					companionship<br/>
					and intimacy with the good.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as in the case of the great reservoir,<br/>
					with only four inlets<br/>

					if a man should open the inlets<br/>
					and close the outlets<br/>
					and if there should be a proper fall of rain,<br/>
					an increase may be expected in that great reservoir<br/>
					and not a lessening;<br/>
					even so, brāhman<br/>
					there are these fpur channels<br/>
					for the flowing in of great wealth:<br/>
					abstinence from looseness with women,<br/>
					from debauchery in drinking,<br/>
					from knavery in dice-play<br/>
					and the friendship,<br/>
					companionship<br/>
					and intimacy with the good.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, brāhman are the four conditions,<br/>
					which lead to a clansman&apos;s advantage and happiness here on earth.</p>

					<p class="f4">These four conditions, brāhman<br/>
					lead to a clansman&apos;s advantage and happiness in the world to come.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Achievement in faith,<br/>
					achievement in virtue,<br/>
					achievement in charity<br/>
					and achievement in wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is achievement in faith?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a clansman has faith and believes in the awakening of the Tathāgata, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a truth he is the Exalted One,<br/>
					arahant,<br/>
					fully awakened,<br/>
					adept in knowledge and conduct,<br/>
					well going,<br/>
					a world-knower,<br/>
					incomparable,<br/>
					a tamer of tamable men,<br/>
					among devas and men the teacher,<br/>
					Buddha,<br/>
					Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called achievement in faith.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is achievement in virtue?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a clansman abstains from taking life<br/>
					from taking what is not given,<br/>
					from carnal lusts,<br/>
					from lying,<br/>
					abstains from taking sloth-causing liquors, spirits, wines.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called achievement in virtue.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is achievement in charity?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a clansman dwells at home<br/>
					with mind free of the stain of meanness;<br/>
					freely bounteous,<br/>
					open-handed,<br/>
					gladly giving,<br/>
					yoke-mate to asking,<br/>
					he is a cheerful giver.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called achievement in charity.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is achievement in wisdom?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a clansman is wise;<br/>
					he is wise as to the way of growth and decay,<br/>
					possessing Ariyan penetration of the way<br/>
					to the utter destruction of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called achievement in wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, brāhman are the four conditions,<br/>
					which lead to a clansman&apos;s advantage and happiness in the world to come.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Up and alert about his task and toil,<br/>
							A careful man, he minds his wealth and lives<br/>
							The even life; and he is virtuous,<br/>
							Believing, kind and bountiful; he clears<br/>
							The onward Way to faring well hereafter.<br/>
							Thus for the believing home-seeker eight states<br/>
							Have been declared by him whose name is Truth&apos;<br/>
							As leading unto happiness both here and then,<br/>
							To bliss hereafter and to welfare now.<br/>
							This is the standard for a householder,<br/>
							For merit grows by generosity.&apos;</p>

					worthy of gifts,<br/>
					worthy of oblations,<br/>
					meet to be reverently saluted,<br/>
					the world&apos;s peerless field for merit.</p>

					<p class="f4">What eight?</p>

					<p class="f4">3. Herein a monk is virtuous,<br/>
					he abides restrained by the restraint of the obligations,<br/>
					perfect in behaviour and conduct,<br/>
					seeing danger in the smallest fault,<br/>
					accepting the training,<br/>
					he trains himself accordantly;</p>

					<p class="f4">4. He is learned,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#485_edn1" id="edfn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					<i>is replete with learning,<br/>
					is a hoard of learning.</i></p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Those doctrines which,<br/>

					lovely at the end<br/>
					both in the meaning and the letter of them,<br/>
					which preach the utterly fulfilled,<br/>

					such doctrines are much heard by him,<br/>
					borne in mind,<br/>
					repeated aloud,<br/>
					pondered over<br/>
					and well penetrated by his vision;</i></p>

					<p class="f4">5. He has good friends,<br/>
					companions and intimates;</p>

					<p class="f4">6. He holds right views and is endowed with wisdom;</p>

					<p class="f4">7. He attains at will,<br/>
					easily and without difficulty to those pleasant states of living, even in this life, the four musings wholly mental;</p>

					<p class="f4">8. He remembers divers past dwellings, that is to say: one birth, two births, or three, or four, or five,<br/>
					or ten, or twenty, or thirty, or forty, or fifty,<br/>
					or a hundred, or a thousand, or a hundred thousand,<br/>
					or many an age of rolling on,<br/>
					or many an age of rolling back,<br/>
					or many an age of both rolling on and rolling back -<br/>
					such an one I was by name,<br/>
					of such a clan,<br/>
					of such a caste,<br/>
					such was my food,<br/>
					such my experience of weal and woe,<br/>
					such was the end of my life,</p>

					<p class="f4">passing away thence,<br/>
					I arose in such a place.</p>

					<p class="f4">there, such was my name,<br/>
					such my clan,<br/>
					such my caste,<br/>
					such my food,<br/>
					such my experience of weal and woe,<br/>
					such my end,</p>

					<p class="f4">passing away from there,<br/>
					I arose here.</p>

					<p class="f4">thus many a previous dwelling<br/>
					he calls to mind<br/>
					with its circumstances and details;</p>

					<p class="f4">9. He knows by the deva eye,<br/>
					purified and surpassing that of mankind,<br/>
					the course of beings -<br/>
					lowly and exalted,<br/>
					beautiful and ugly,<br/>
					happy and in woe,<br/>
					according to their deeds;</p>

					<p class="f4">And he thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;These worthies were given over to evil practices<br/>
					in act, word and thought,<br/>
					were revilers of the Ariyans,<br/>
					holders of wrong views,<br/>
					men who have acquired this karma<br/>
					from wrong views;<br/>
					and on the breaking up of the body after death,<br/>
					have arisen in the untoward way,<br/>
					the ill way,<br/>
					the abyss,<br/>
					hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">But these good sirs behaved rightly<br/>
					in act, word and thought,<br/>
					were no revilers of the Ariyans,<br/>
					held right views<br/>
					and have acquired this karma therefrom;<br/>
					and on the breaking up of the body after death,<br/>
					have arisen in the blissful heaven world.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with the deva-eye<br/>
					purified and surpassing the human eye,<br/>
					he sees and knows beings<br/>
					in course of faring on -<br/>
					beings lowly and exalted,<br/>
					beautiful and ugly,<br/>
					happy and in woe,<br/>
					according to their deeds.</p>

					<p class="f4">10. By destroying the cankers,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the emancipation of the heart and wisdom,<br/>
					which is cankerless,<br/>
					and this state he knows and realizes for himself,<br/>
					even in this life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, a monk who is endowed with these eight qualities<br/>
					is worthy of offerings,<br/>
					worthy of gifts,<br/>
					worthy of oblations,<br/>
					meet to be reverently saluted,<br/>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx408 marl6">
							<p>GS iii, pg.x, on <i>nivāsa:</i> It is good to have a term from one of those <i>abhiññās</i> used at last in its literal meaning. This is &apos;dwelling(s),&apos; replacing themore usual &apos;births&apos; or &apos;lives&apos; in the reminiscence of one&apos;s past previous to this life: - <i>pubbe-nivās&apos;ānussati</i> (p. 13, etc.). This apparently curious choice made by the Buddhist teachers has a significance which will not strike a European. What is that?<br/>
							Why the choice of &apos;dwelling,&apos; when in Pāli we have &apos;birth,&apos; &apos;rebirth,&apos; &apos;live,&apos; &apos;world&apos;? I see it thus: Consider first the formula (p.13), or its more formal, more usual wording (p. 296): - &apos;he remembers manifoldly appointed dwellings in thepast.&apos; This is followed by an exposition, careful as to the &apos;dwelling&apos; being as inmate of a body, a society, a world, extravagant as to length and number, in which &apos;births&apos; <i>(jātiyo)</i> is freely used. But the very usual word (in later years) for &apos;lives&apos; and &apos;worlds,&apos; <i>bhavā,</i> is not used. What may be the explanation? I suggest the following:<br/>
							(i) The formula &apos;he ... the past&apos; is the <i>original fixed wording,</i> or &apos;text.&apos;<br/>
							(ii) The exposition, long left to the exponent, became appended, in its odd medley, later.<br/>
							(iii) When (i) was first listed, the word rendered &apos;dwellings&apos; meant, not merely a house, but a &apos;nest,&apos; a &apos;settlement,&apos; an &apos;ingress&apos; on the other hand, the word <i>jāti</i> did not fit <a id="515_pgxi"><span class="f2 g"><b>[xi]</b></span></a> for &apos;life.&apos; It meant (a) birth on earth, (6) rank in the brahman, (c) happening, (d) a producing or source. Later on, the plural in the sense of &apos;new lives&apos; became permissible.<br/>
							(iv) The word for &apos;life&apos; <i>(jīvita)</i> was never used in the plural; the word for &apos;world&apos; <i>(loka)</i> in the plural is very hard to find till in later Pali. [note: There is one plural in this volume: <i>lokāsu.</i>]<br/>
							(v) The word that came to be used for both &apos;lives&apos; and &apos;worlds,&apos; &apos;becomings&apos; <i>(bhavā),</i> had <i>not so come into use</i> when the exposition (ii) was finally worded.<br/>
							(vi) Original Buddhism taught that man was a wayfarer in many worlds.<br/>
							Hence I come to this: - recollection of the past was of former homes, stations, rests, stages, rather than of &apos;births&apos; or of &apos;lives&apos;; hence <i>nivāsā.</i><br/>
							- C.A.F. Rhys Davids, Chipstead, Surrey, September, 1933.</p>

							<p>The note reads: <i>&quot;Windisch, <i>Mara und Buddha,</i> p. 75, makes this number refer to the number of entrances, and quotes <a href="#18_pg15"><i>Itivuttaka,</i> p. 15,</a> in support. The Singhalese version (p. 758) is as above.&quot;</i> The passage in the <i>Itivuttaka</i> speaks of rebirth as Sakka 36 times, and of rebirth as a wheel-turning King hundreds of times, but the Pali is not related to this situation, but speaks of &apos;habitations&apos; (rebirths) <i>satta vassāni...</i>. From the context of this sutta Windisch and Hare&apos;s translation fits better. What appears to be being spoken of is The Buddha transforming his appearance, etc. in his then current life during hundreds of different visits (not rebirths). The Pali is <i>anekasataɱ ~parisaɱ upasaŋkamitā</i> which is literally &apos;not (just) one hundred ~assemblies approaching (not &quot;rising up in&quot; as in rebirth)&apos;. Bhk. Bodhi goes the other way and has this as the number of those assembled. The issue here is: Did the Buddha make a practice of going round to various assemblies (say, even around the world) to implant Dhamma without attracting attention to the extra-normal manner in which it was done. The visits covered the full spectrum of assemblies which would indicate that this was a deliberate course of action. If he did this in the virtical direction (up and down the scale of realms), why not in the horizontal? ... hundreds of assemblies.] </p>

					<p class="f4">This, Ānanda, is the second cause,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Again, Ānanda, when a being awakening quits the Tusita assembly<br/>

					his mother&apos;s womb;<br/>

					<p class="f4">When a Tathāgata sets rolling the unsurpassed wheel of Dhamma;<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">When a Tathāgata, mindful and self-possessed,<br/>

					<p class="f4">And when he had thus spoken, the Exalted One said to those monks: </p>

					by trading<br/>
					or by cattle-herding,<br/>
					by archery<br/>
					or as a rajah&apos;s man,<br/>
					or by any of the crafts -<br/>

					<p class="f4">Herein, whatsoever wealth a clansman get together by work and zeal,<br/>
					collect by the strength of his arm,<br/>
					earn by the sweat of his brow<br/>
					and justly obtain in a lawful manner -<br/>
					such he husbands by watch and ward, thinking:</p>

					nor thieves filch it,<br/>
					nor fire consume it,<br/>
					nor water carry it off,<br/>
					nor ill-disposed heirs make off with it?&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called achievement in wariness.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Monks, is good company?</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called good company.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Monks, is the even life?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a clansman<br/>
					while experiencing both gain and loss in wealth,<br/>
					continues his business serenely,<br/>
					not unduly elated or depressed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thinks he:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Thus my income,<br/>
					after deducting the loss,<br/>
					will stand (at so much)<br/>
					and my outgoings will not exceed my income.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as one who carries scales,<br/>
					or his apprentice,<br/>
					knows, on holding up the balance,<br/>
					that either by so much it has dipped down<br/>
					or by so much it has tilted up;<br/>
					even so, Monks,<br/>
					a clansman experiencing both gain and loss<br/>
					continues his business serenely,<br/>
					neither unduly elated<br/>
					nor unduly depressed,<br/>
					but realizes that<br/>
					after allowing for the loss<br/>
					his income will stand at so much<br/>
					and that his outgoings will not exceed his income.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, Monks, this clansman have but small earnings<br/>
					and live on a grand scale,<br/>
					it will be rumoured of him:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;This clansman eats his wealth<br/>
					like a fig-tree glutton.&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">And if his earnings be great<br/>
					and he live meanly,<br/>
					rumour will say of him:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;This clansman will die like a starveling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore this clansman while experiencing both gain and loss in wealth,<br/>
					continues his business serenely,<br/>
					not unduly elated or depressed,<br/>
					but realizes that<br/>
					after allowing for the loss<br/>
					his income will stand at so much<br/>
					and that his outgoings will not exceed his income.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the even life.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is achievement in faith?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a clansman has faith and believes in the awakening of the Tathāgata, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a truth he is the Exalted One,<br/>
					arahant,<br/>
					fully awakened,<br/>
					adept in knowledge and conduct,<br/>
					well going,<br/>
					a world-knower,<br/>
					incomparable,<br/>
					a tamer of tamable men,<br/>
					among devas and men the teacher,<br/>
					Buddha,<br/>
					Exalted One.</p>

							<p>Hare has abridged this entire sutta with the note: &quot;(<a href="#561_">§75</a> is repeated and then follows the explanation as given in <a href="#467_">§ 54,</a> together with the <i>gāthā.</i>)&quot; and footnoting as here. However there is another possibility which allows for the sutta to have been an original creation of Gotama and that is that he wished the bhikkhus to have knowledge of things that are to the advantage of laymen. The snooty attitude of the bhikkhu here (which is found in some bhikkhus even today) is short-sighted: such knowledge imparted to the lay community would incline laymen to greater generosity to the bhikkhus.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a href="#563_fn1" id="n1">1</a>]</sup> This seems to show that the compilers were not satisfied in merely having the teaching of this sutta, which is obviously for the layman, but must have it specially taught to the monks. I quote Mrs. Rhys Davids&apos; Gotama 204: &apos;The talks with Visakha, with the Kosala king, with Sigala and a few more - the repeaters and editors did not care for these. As a rule they did not go on repeating these sayings. ... They said: &quot;But these persons are not of our world. They are only laymen. They have not the right wisdom ...&apos;</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One,<br/>
					while wandering for alms<br/>
					with a great company of monks<br/>
					among the Kosalese,<br/>
					came to the brāhman <a id="596_pg224"><span class="f2 g"><b>[224]</b></span></a> village called <a href="#11_icchanangala">Icchānaŋgala,</a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#596_n1" id="fn1">1</a>]</sup></span><br/>
					belonging to them.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there he dwelt in Icchānaŋgala, Wood.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the brahman householders of Icchānaŋgala heard the news:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Tis said Master Gotama, the Sakya,<br/>
					a wanderer from out the Sakyan clan,<br/>
					has arrived at Icchānaŋgala,<br/>
					and dwells in the Wood near by.</p>

					<p class="f4">And of that same Master Gotama,<br/>
					this good repute is noised abroad:</p>

					<p class="f4">&apos;He is the Exalted One,<br/>
					arahant,<br/>
					the perfect Buddha,<br/>
					adept in knowledge and conduct,<br/>
					well going,<br/>
					a world-knower,<br/>

					a tamer of tamable men,<br/>

					Buddha,<br/>
					Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well indeed it is to see such arahants!&apos;&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">So at the end of that night,<br/>
					the brahman householders of Icchānaŋgala,<br/>
					taking with them much hard and soft food,<br/>
					went to Icchānaŋgala, Wood<br/>
					and waited outside the gateway,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Nāgita<br/>
					was the personal attendant of the Exalted One.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#596_n2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One called the venerable Nāgita<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#596_n3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span> and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Who are these, Nāgita<br/>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Lord, these are the Icchānaŋgala, brahman householders,<br/>

					<p class="f4">They have brought much hard and soft food<br/>

					<p class="f4">&quot;Lord, let the Exalted One accept (their offering);<br/>
